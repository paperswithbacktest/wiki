## What is the Investment Canada Act?

The Investment Canada Act is a law in Canada that controls and reviews foreign investments in Canadian businesses. It makes sure that these investments are good for Canada. The government checks big investments to see if they help the country's economy, create jobs, and keep important industries safe.

The Act has rules about how much a foreign company can invest in a Canadian business. For example, if a foreign company wants to buy a big Canadian business, they need to tell the government and get approval. The government looks at things like the effect on the economy, culture, and national security. If the investment is not good for Canada, the government can say no to it.

## What is the purpose of the Investment Canada Act?

The Investment Canada Act is a law that helps make sure foreign investments in Canada are good for the country. It lets the Canadian government check big investments to see if they will help the economy, create jobs, and keep important industries safe. This way, Canada can grow and stay strong.

The Act sets rules on how much foreign companies can invest in Canadian businesses. If a foreign company wants to buy a big Canadian business, they have to tell the government and get permission. The government looks at things like the impact on the economy, culture, and national security. If the investment is not good for Canada, the government can stop it from happening.

## Who does the Investment Canada Act apply to?

The Investment Canada Act applies to foreign investors who want to buy or invest in Canadian businesses. A foreign investor can be a person or a company from another country. If the investment is big enough, the foreign investor has to tell the Canadian government about it and get approval before they can go ahead with the deal.

The Act covers different types of investments, like buying a Canadian business or starting a new one in Canada. It mostly focuses on big investments that could affect Canada's economy a lot. The government checks these investments to make sure they are good for Canada and do not harm important industries or national security.

## What types of investments are covered under the Act?

The Investment Canada Act covers different types of investments that foreign investors want to make in Canadian businesses. This includes buying an existing Canadian business or starting a new one in Canada. The Act mainly focuses on big investments that could have a big impact on Canada's economy.

When a foreign investor wants to buy a Canadian business, they need to tell the government if the investment is big enough. The government then checks the investment to make sure it will be good for Canada. This includes looking at how it might affect the economy, jobs, culture, and national security. If the investment could harm important industries or national security, the government might not allow it.

## How does the review process under the Investment Canada Act work?

The review process under the Investment Canada Act starts when a foreign investor wants to buy a big Canadian business. If the investment is big enough, the investor has to tell the Canadian government about it. The government then looks at the investment to see if it will be good for Canada. They check things like how it will affect the economy, if it will create jobs, and if it will help or hurt important industries.

The government has a certain amount of time to review the investment, usually around 45 days. During this time, they might ask for more information from the investor. If the government thinks the investment is good for Canada, they will let it go ahead. But if they think it might harm the economy, important industries, or national security, they can say no to the investment. This helps make sure that foreign investments help Canada grow and stay strong.

## What are the thresholds for review under the Investment Canada Act?

The Investment Canada Act has different thresholds for when a foreign investment needs to be reviewed. For investors from countries with a trade agreement with Canada, like the United States or the European Union, the threshold is higher. They need to invest at least $1.9 billion in a Canadian business to trigger a review. For investors from countries without a trade agreement, the threshold is lower, at $1.287 billion. If the investment is in a cultural business, like a movie studio or a publishing company, the threshold is even lower, at $5 million for direct investments and $50 million for indirect investments.

If the investment is smaller than these thresholds, it might still need to be reported to the government, but it won't automatically be reviewed. The government can still decide to review smaller investments if they think it might affect national security. This means that even if an investment is below the threshold, the government can still look at it closely if they have concerns about how it might impact Canada's safety or important industries.

## What factors are considered during the net benefit review?

During the net benefit review under the Investment Canada Act, the government looks at several things to see if a foreign investment is good for Canada. They check if the investment will help the Canadian economy grow. This includes seeing if it will create new jobs, increase the amount of goods and services produced in Canada, and help Canadian companies compete better in the world. The government also looks at how the investment will affect different parts of Canada, making sure it helps in different areas and not just one place.

Another thing the government considers is the effect on Canadians. They want to know if the investment will help improve technology and industry in Canada, and if it will be good for Canadian workers and their families. They also look at how the investment might affect Canada's culture and how it will help or hurt important industries. If the government thinks the investment will bring more good than harm, they will say it has a net benefit and let it go ahead.

## How does the national security review process differ from the net benefit review?

The national security review process under the Investment Canada Act is different from the net benefit review because it focuses on protecting Canada from any harm to its safety. If the government thinks a foreign investment could be a risk to national security, they can start a national security review at any time, even if the investment is small and does not need a net benefit review. During this review, the government looks at things like how the investment might affect military technology, critical infrastructure, or sensitive personal data. If they find that the investment is a real threat, they can stop it or make the investor do certain things to make it safer.

The net benefit review, on the other hand, looks at how good an investment is for Canada's economy. This review happens when a foreign investor wants to buy a big Canadian business and the investment is above a certain amount of money. The government checks if the investment will help the economy grow, create jobs, and support important industries. They want to make sure the investment brings more good than harm to Canada. If the investment passes this review, it can go ahead, but if it fails, the government can stop it from happening.

## What are the potential outcomes of a review under the Investment Canada Act?

When the Canadian government reviews a foreign investment under the Investment Canada Act, there are a few things that can happen. If the investment is going through a net benefit review, the government will look at how it will help Canada's economy. If they think the investment will bring more good than harm, they will approve it. But if they think it will hurt the economy or important industries, they can say no and stop the investment from happening.

For a national security review, the focus is on keeping Canada safe. If the government thinks the investment could be a risk to national security, they can start a review at any time, even if the investment is small. If they find that the investment is a real threat, they can stop it completely or make the investor do certain things to make it safer. This way, Canada can protect itself while still welcoming investments that are good for the country.

## What are the penalties for non-compliance with the Investment Canada Act?

If a foreign investor does not follow the rules of the Investment Canada Act, they can face big penalties. If they make an investment without telling the government when they should have, they could be fined up to $25,000 for each day they did not report it. If they go ahead with an investment that the government said no to, they could be fined up to $500,000.

The government can also make the investor undo the investment if it was not approved. This means the investor might have to sell the Canadian business they bought or stop the new business they started. These rules are in place to make sure foreign investors follow the law and help keep Canada's economy and safety strong.

## How have recent amendments affected the application of the Investment Canada Act?

Recent changes to the Investment Canada Act have made it easier for the government to review foreign investments that might be a risk to Canada's safety. Before, the government could only start a national security review if the investment was reported or if they found out about it within a certain time. Now, they can start a review at any time if they think an investment could be a problem. This means they can look at more investments and make sure they are safe for Canada.

The changes also made the rules clearer about what the government can do if they find a problem with an investment. They can now tell the investor to do things to make the investment safer, like selling part of the business or letting the government check on it more often. These new rules help Canada stay safe while still welcoming investments that are good for the country.

## Can you provide examples of high-profile cases reviewed under the Investment Canada Act?

One high-profile case was when BHP Billiton, a big mining company from Australia, wanted to buy PotashCorp, a Canadian company that makes fertilizer. In 2010, BHP Billiton offered to buy PotashCorp for about $39 billion. The Canadian government looked at this investment to see if it would be good for Canada. They decided that it would not help the economy enough and might hurt the potash industry, so they said no to the deal. This was a big decision because it showed that Canada would stop big foreign investments if they were not good for the country.

Another example is when the Chinese company Anbang Insurance Group wanted to buy Retirement Concepts, a company that runs nursing homes in Canada. In 2017, Anbang made a deal to buy Retirement Concepts for about $1 billion. The Canadian government started a national security review because they were worried about a foreign company owning so many nursing homes. In the end, Anbang had to sell the nursing homes to a Canadian company. This case showed that the government will look closely at investments that could affect important services like healthcare.

## What are the thresholds and regulations for investments?

Foreign direct investments (FDI) in Canada are regulated under the Investment Canada Act (ICA), and these investments are subject to specific thresholds that determine the nature of the review process. The thresholds serve as benchmarks to assess whether a particular foreign investment in Canada merits a detailed governmental review.

### Value Thresholds

The principal method to evaluate investments under the ICA is through the assessment of "enterprise value" and "asset value." These values are crucial metrics that define the significance of the investment:

- **Enterprise Value**: This is typically calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Enterprise Value} = \text{Market Capitalization} + \text{Debt} - \text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}
$$

This value gives an indication of the total value of a business, including cash and equivalents and shareholder equity minus debt. It serves as an effective measure for larger and publicly traded companies.

- **Asset Value**: This is simply the total book value of the assets possessed by the Canadian business in question. This measure is more frequently applied to smaller and privately held businesses where enterprise value is less applicable.

### Sector-Specific and Origin-Based Thresholds

The ICA applies different thresholds depending on the origin of the investor and the sector in which the target business operates. Particularly in cultural industries, which are viewed as sensitive due to their impact on Canadian cultural identity and heritage, the thresholds are lower and more stringent.

1. **Investor Origin**: There are differing threshold requirements depending on whether the investor is from a nation with a trade agreement with Canada (like the United States, Mexico, the European Union, CPTPP members) or from a country without such agreements. Investors from trade-agreement countries generally face higher thresholds for scrutiny.

2. **Cultural Industries**: Investments in cultural industries (such as film, music, and publishing) are subject to more rigorous examination given that these sectors are closely monitored to preserve Canadian cultural priorities. Lower thresholds ensure that even smaller investments receive appropriate attention.

### Recent Changes

The ICA has evolved to accommodate changing global investment patterns, and a significant recent change is the option for foreign investors to voluntarily notify the Canadian government about investments that might involve non-controlling minority stakes. This allows the government to assess any potential risks these investments might pose, especially with regard to national security concerns, without imposing mandatory review processes that might deter investment.

By understanding these thresholds and regulations, potential foreign investors can better gauge the level of scrutiny their investments might face and prepare accordingly to align with Canadian economic and security priorities.

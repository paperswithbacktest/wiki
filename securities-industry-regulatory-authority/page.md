## How does SIRA differ from other financial regulatory bodies?

SIRA is special because it focuses only on the stock market. Other financial regulatory bodies might look at banks, insurance companies, or other parts of the money world. SIRA makes rules just for the stock market and checks to make sure everyone follows them. This helps keep the stock market fair and safe for people who invest their money there.

Another way SIRA is different is that it works hard to teach people about the stock market. While other financial regulators might also do some education, SIRA puts a big focus on it. They give out information and tools to help people learn how to invest wisely. This makes SIRA not just a rule-maker, but also a helper for people who want to understand the stock market better.

## What types of securities does SIRA regulate?

SIRA regulates different types of securities that people can buy and sell in the stock market. This includes stocks, which are shares in a company. When you buy a stock, you own a small part of that company. SIRA also regulates bonds, which are like loans that people give to companies or governments. In return, the company or government pays back the money with interest over time.

Another type of security that SIRA oversees is mutual funds. These are collections of stocks and bonds managed by professionals. People can invest in mutual funds to spread their money across many different investments, which can be less risky than putting all their money in one stock or bond. SIRA makes sure that all these securities are traded fairly and that the people selling them follow the rules.

## How does SIRA ensure compliance among its regulated entities?

SIRA makes sure that everyone follows the rules by checking on them regularly. They look at what companies and people in the stock market are doing to see if they are following the rules. If SIRA finds that someone is not following the rules, they can take action. This might mean giving a warning, making the person or company pay a fine, or even stopping them from working in the stock market.

SIRA also helps people understand the rules better. They provide training and information to help companies and individuals know what they are supposed to do.

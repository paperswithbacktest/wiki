Some also worry that raising the minimum wage could make it harder for small businesses to pay their workers, which might lead to fewer jobs.

Another challenge is that Biden's plans need support from Congress to become law. If the people in Congress don't agree with his ideas, it could be hard to get them passed. Some people also think that Biden's plans might not help everyone equally. For example, some worry that the money spent on green energy might not reach all parts of the country or all types of workers.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow import keras

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("market_data.csv")
X = data.drop('price', axis=1)
y = data['price']

# Split data into training and testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Build a neural network
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=[X_train.shape[1]]),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, validation_split=0.2, verbose=1)

# Evaluate the model
loss, mae = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")
```

This script sets up a neural network intended to predict commodity prices, incorporating advanced data preprocessing and model validation techniques integral to modern algo trading strategies.

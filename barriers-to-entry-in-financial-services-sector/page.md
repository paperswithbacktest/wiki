def generate_signals(prices, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=prices.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Calculate short and long SMAs
    signals['short_mavg'] = simple_moving_average(prices['Close'], short_window)
    signals['long_mavg'] = simple_moving_average(prices['Close'], long_window)

    # Create the signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(
        signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
    return signals

# Example usage
prices = pd.DataFrame({'Close': [120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]})

```python
import yfinance as yf

def check_price_and_buy(stock_symbol, target_price):
    stock_data = yf.Ticker(stock_symbol)
    current_price = stock_data.history(period='1d')['Close'][-1]

    if current_price <= target_price:
        execute_trade(stock_symbol, "buy", current_price)

def execute_trade(stock_symbol, action, price):
    print(f"Executing {action} for {stock_symbol} at ${price}")

# Example usage
check_price_and_buy('AAPL', 130)
```

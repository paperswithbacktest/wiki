Algorithmic trading systems, which are programmed to capitalize on such price movements, can execute trades more efficiently, improving the chances of capturing favorable price points. A simplified Python-based representation of an algorithm adjusting to improved speeds might look like this:

```python
def optimized_trade_logic(current_price, historical_prices, transaction_costs):
    # Analyze historical prices to identify trends
    trend = analyze_trends(historical_prices)

    if trend == 'upward':
        # Execute buy order if the trend suggests an upward trajectory
        execute_trade('buy', current_price, transaction_costs)
    elif trend == 'downward':
        # Execute sell order if the trend suggests a downward trajectory
        execute_trade('sell', current_price, transaction_costs)

def analyze_trends(prices):
    # Basic trend analysis logic (e.g., moving average)
    moving_average = sum(prices[-5:]) / 5
    return 'upward' if prices[-1] > moving_average else 'downward'
```
The upgrade also introduces a more dynamic market environment, which might necessitate the recalibration of existing trading algorithms.

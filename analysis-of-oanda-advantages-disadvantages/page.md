The spread is how OANDA makes money from your trades. They don't charge a separate commission for most trades, but the spread can be different depending on which currencies you're trading and how busy the market is.

For currency conversion, OANDA has a fee that depends on how much money you're changing and which currencies you're using. This fee is usually a percentage of the amount you're converting. If you use OANDA's payment services, like sending money abroad, there might be extra fees for the transfer.

## Can you explain the leverage options available at OANDA and their risks?

OANDA offers something called leverage, which lets you trade with more money than you actually have. If you want to trade a big amount but don't have enough money, leverage can help.

This can be really helpful because it lets you make bigger trades and possibly earn more money. But, you need to be careful because leverage can also make you lose more money if the trade doesn't go your way.

The big risk with leverage is that it can make your losses bigger. If the market moves against you, you can lose more than the money you put in. That's why it's important to understand how leverage works and use it carefully. OANDA has rules to protect you, like margin calls, which tell you if you need to add more money to your account.

# Example of a simple algorithmic trading strategy in Python
import numpy as np

def simple_moving_average(prices, window):
    """Calculate simple moving average for the given prices."""
    return np.convolve(prices, np.ones(window), 'valid') / window

def algo_strategy(prices, short_window, long_window):
    """A basic strategy using a simple moving average crossover."""
    short_sma = simple_moving_average(prices, short_window)
    long_sma = simple_moving_average(prices, long_window)

    # Generate buy/sell signals
    signals = np.zeros(len(prices))
    signals[short_window:] = np.where(short_sma > long_sma, 1.0, 0.0)

    # Buy/sell based on signal
    positions = np.diff(signals)

    return positions, signals

# Example price data
prices = np.array([1.1, 1.2, 1.15, 1.18, 1.25, 1.3, 1.35, 1.4])
short_window = 2
long_window = 3

positions, signals = algo_strategy(prices, short_window, long_window)
print("Positions:", positions)
print("Signals:", signals)
```

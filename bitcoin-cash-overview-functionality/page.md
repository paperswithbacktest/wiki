    'Asset2': [0.015, -0.02, 0.025],
    'Asset3': [-0.005, 0.01, 0.007]
})

# Function to calculate portfolio variance
def portfolio_variance(weights, returns_data):
    cov_matrix = returns_data.cov()
    portfolio_variance = np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(cov_matrix, weights))
    return portfolio_variance

# Initial guess and bounds for weights
initial_weights = np.array([1/3, 1/3, 1/3])
bounds = tuple((0, 1) for asset in range(len(returns_data.columns)))
constraints = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda x: np.sum(x) - 1})

# Minimize portfolio variance for diversification
result = minimize(portfolio_variance, initial_weights, args=(returns_data,),
                  method='SLSQP', bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)

# Optimal weights
optimal_weights = result.x

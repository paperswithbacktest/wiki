For example, an algorithm might be programmed to buy a stock when its 50-day moving average surpasses the 200-day moving average. This is a common technical indicator used to identify trading opportunities. In Python, this could be implemented using a simple script:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data for stock prices
data = {'price': [100, 102, 104, 106, 105, 107, 108]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate moving averages
df['50_MA'] = df['price'].rolling(window=50).mean()
df['200_MA'] = df['price'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Trading signal
df['signal'] = (df['50_MA'] > df['200_MA']).astype(int)
```

The adoption of algorithmic trading has grown among top-tier banks as it serves as a strategic asset in maintaining a competitive edge in the financial markets. By automating trades, banks reduce the risk of human error and lessen the influence of emotional factors, leading to more consistent trading outcomes and enhanced risk management.

In conclusion, algorithmic trading has transformed from a specialty tool of niche trading entities to a cornerstone of major banks' trading strategies. Its ability to analyze and act on large data sets quickly and accurately underscores its importance in contemporary financial markets.

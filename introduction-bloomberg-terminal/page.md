# Calculate moving averages
short_window = 2
long_window = 3

data['short_mavg'] = data['price'].rolling(window=short_window).mean()
data['long_mavg'] = data['price'].rolling(window=long_window).mean()

# Determine buy/sell signals
data['signal'] = 0
data.loc[data['short_mavg'] > data['long_mavg'], 'signal'] = 1
data.loc[data['short_mavg'] < data['long_mavg'], 'signal'] = -1

print(data)

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Assuming X is the feature matrix and y is the target variable
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the classifier
rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Fit the classifier with the training data
rf_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

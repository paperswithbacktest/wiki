## What is the Approach to Risk Management?

Larry Hite's approach to risk management is renowned for its emphasis on defensive strategies. He famously stated that profits take care of themselves if risks are managed. This philosophy underscores the importance of evaluating potential losses prior to considering potential gains. By focusing on the downside, Hite ensures that the trading strategy remains robust irrespective of market fluctuations.

A cornerstone of Hite's risk management philosophy is diversification. He believes that spreading investments across various asset classes can mitigate potential losses, reducing exposure to any single market event. This reduces the correlation of returns and helps in preserving capital during downturns.

Volatility-based position sizing is another pivotal component of Hite's approach. This method involves adjusting the size of a position based on the asset's [volatility](/wiki/volatility-trading-strategies), thereby maintaining a consistent level of risk across different trades. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
\text{Position Size} = \frac{\text{Risk Capital} \times \text{Risk per Trade (\%)}}{\text{Volatility (Standard Deviation)}}
$$

Using this formula allows traders to scale their positions according to market conditions, ensuring that they do not overextend themselves in more volatile environments.

Furthermore, Hite integrates the use of stop-loss orders, a critical tool in protecting capital. Stop-loss orders automatically execute a trade to [exit](/wiki/exit-strategy) a position at a predetermined price, limiting potential losses. This automated process ensures adherence to the trading plan and eliminates emotional bias from decision-making.

Hite's strict adherence to trading plans serves as the backbone of his risk management strategy. By establishing predetermined rules and criteria for entering and exiting trades, traders can navigate markets with discipline and avoid impulsive decisions that could lead to significant losses. Such an approach not only protects capital but also contributes to a consistent trading performance over the long term.

Overall, Larry Hite's risk management strategies have set a benchmark in trading, emphasizing the protection of capital and the systematic assessment of risk. His principles are widely regarded and continue to guide traders aiming for longevity and success in the financial markets.

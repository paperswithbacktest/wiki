## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a type of digital money that you can use to buy things online. It's different from regular money because it's not controlled by any government or bank. Instead, it uses a technology called blockchain, which is like a big, public record book that keeps track of all Bitcoin transactions. People can send and receive Bitcoins through the internet, and it's all done securely without needing a middleman like a bank.

To get Bitcoins, you can buy them with regular money on special websites called exchanges, or you can earn them by solving complex math problems, a process known as mining. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by someone using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, and since then, it has become very popular.

If you buy Bitcoin and its price drops, you could lose money. Also, even though Fidelity uses good technology to keep your Bitcoin safe, there's always a small chance that something could go wrong and you could lose your Bitcoin.

Another risk is that Bitcoin is still new and not everyone understands it well.

## What regulatory considerations does Fidelity need to address with Bitcoin?

Fidelity needs to follow the rules set by governments and financial watchdogs when they deal with Bitcoin. These rules can be different in each country, so Fidelity has to make sure they know and follow all of them. For example, they need to check who their customers are to stop bad people from using Bitcoin for illegal things. They also have to report any big Bitcoin transactions to the right authorities.

Another thing Fidelity has to think about is how taxes work with Bitcoin. Different places have different tax rules for digital money, and Fidelity needs to help their customers understand and follow these rules. If the rules change, Fidelity has to keep up with the changes and make sure they are still doing everything right. This can be tricky because Bitcoin is still new and the rules are still being figured out.

## How does Fidelity's approach to Bitcoin compare to other financial institutions?

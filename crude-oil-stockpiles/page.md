## Understanding Crude Oil Stockpiles

Crude oil stockpiles, measured in barrels, serve as critical reserves of unrefined petroleum. These inventories are pivotal in mitigating the impacts of supply and demand fluctuations, thereby significantly influencing oil prices. When supply exceeds demand, stockpiles increase, often leading to a decrease in prices as the surplus oil saturates the market. Conversely, when demand surpasses supply, stockpile drawdowns occur, which can lead to price hikes as scarcity drives market dynamics.

Several factors contribute to the fluctuations in crude oil stockpiles. Geopolitical events, such as conflicts or diplomatic tensions, can disrupt production or transportation, affecting stockpile levels. For instance, political instability in oil-rich regions may lead to production cutbacks, reducing global supply and tightening stockpiles.

# Sample data: A pandas DataFrame with crude oil prices
prices = pd.DataFrame({'Date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03'], 
                       'WTI': [75, 76, 78], 
                       'Brent': [80, 81, 83]})

# Calculate a simple moving average for a defined window
def simple_moving_average(data, window_size):
    return data.rolling(window=window_size).mean()

# Example: Calculate the 2-day simple moving average
wti_sma = simple_moving_average(prices['WTI'], window_size=2)
print(wti_sma)
```

Event-driven strategies in crude oil trading seek to capitalize on market-moving events such as geopolitical developments or macroeconomic data releases.

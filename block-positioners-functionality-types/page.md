data['MA200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Generate trading signals
data['Signal'] = 0
data.loc[data['MA50'] > data['MA200'], 'Signal'] = 1
data.loc[data['MA50'] < data['MA200'], 'Signal'] = -1

# Visualize trading signals
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(14,7))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price')
plt.plot(data['MA50'], label='50-Day MA')
plt.plot(data['MA200'], label='200-Day MA')
plt.plot(data.loc[data['Signal'] == 1].index, data['MA50'][data['Signal'] == 1], '^', color='g', label='Buy Signal')

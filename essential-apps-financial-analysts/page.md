## What are the top financial apps for analysts?

Financial analysts increasingly rely on specialized apps to manage, analyze, and visualize vast amounts of data efficiently. The following are some of the top financial apps that every analyst should consider incorporating into their toolkit to enhance their analytical capabilities and decision-making processes.

The **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) App** is an essential tool for analysts who require comprehensive economic data. Managed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, this app provides access to over 820,000 data series covering a wide array of categories, including GDP, interest rates, employment [statistics](/wiki/bayesian-statistics), and more. This vast repository of data supports analysts in conducting economic research, generating forecasts, and contextualizing market movements. The convenience of having access to such a breadth of data on a mobile application allows analysts to stay updated with global and domestic market conditions, thereby supporting informed decision-making.

The **uValue App** is particularly beneficial for financial analysts engaged in corporate valuations. Created by Professor Aswath Damodaran of New York University, this app includes calculators for key valuation metrics such as Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and Adjusted Present Value (APV). By streamlining complex calculations and providing an intuitive interface, uValue enables analysts to efficiently assess a company's value. For instance, the WACC is vital for determining the cost of financing a company's operations and is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{WACC} = \left( \frac{E}{V} \times Re \right) + \left( \frac{D}{V} \times Rd \times (1-Tc) \right)
$$

where:
- $E$ is the market value of equity,
- $V$ is the total market value of equity and debt,
- $Re$ is the cost of equity,
- $D$ is the market value of debt,
- $Rd$ is the cost of debt, and
- $Tc$ is the corporate tax rate.

The **TheStreet App** is another valuable resource for analysts who require real-time financial news, stock analysis, and market commentary. Founded by financial journalist Jim Cramer, TheStreet offers a platform where users can access the latest news and expert insights into the stock market. This app not only helps analysts keep abreast of current trends and developments but also provides tools for stock analysis through charts and detailed reports. Through its stock screener feature, analysts can filter stocks based on multiple criteria, enabling targeted analysis for investment decisions.

These apps provide financial analysts with powerful tools for enhancing productivity, conducting thorough analyses, and staying informed about market developments. By integrating these applications into their daily workflow, analysts can effectively transform data into actionable insights.

More advanced strategies can integrate [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning) and [artificial intelligence](/wiki/ai-artificial-intelligence), allowing algorithms to adapt dynamically to market conditions. The code snippet below demonstrates a basic example of a moving average crossover strategy using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data for stock prices
data = {'Close': [150, 152, 153, 155, 157, 158]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate the short-term moving average (e.g., 2 days)
df['Short_MA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=2).mean()

# Calculate the long-term moving average (e.g., 3 days)
df['Long_MA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=3).mean()

# Generate signals: 1 for buy, -1 for sell
df['Signal'] = np.where(df['Short_MA'] > df['Long_MA'], 1, -1)

print(df)
```

This example provides a basic approach to algorithmic execution, but in practice, considerably more sophisticated models are employed to ensure profitability. These algorithms can process and react to market changes in milliseconds, outperforming human traders in speed and efficiency.

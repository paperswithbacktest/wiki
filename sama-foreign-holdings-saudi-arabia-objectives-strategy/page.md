## What is your investment strategy and philosophy?

SAMA Foreign Holdings, overseen by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, emphasizes a cautious investment strategy centered around low-risk, fixed-income securities. This approach reflects the fund's commitment to preserving capital while aiming for steady returns, a common trait amongst sovereign wealth funds seeking to secure national financial stability.

Despite the lack of transparency regarding its specific asset allocations, SAMA is recognized for its market proficiency and technical acumen. This reputation suggests a sophisticated understanding of global economic dynamics, which informs its investment decisions. A significant element underpinning SAMA's strategy is diversification. By spreading investments across various asset classes and geographies, SAMA seeks to mitigate risks associated with market [volatility](/wiki/volatility-trading-strategies). Diversification serves as a hedge against potential downturns in any single market or asset type, thereby contributing to a balanced and resilient portfolio.

Diversification can be mathematically expressed in terms of portfolio variance, which is minimized according to the formula:

$$
\sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_i w_j \sigma_{ij}
$$

In this equation, $\sigma_p^2$ represents the portfolio variance, $w_i$ and $w_j$ are the weights of assets $i$ and $j$ in the portfolio, and $\sigma_{ij}$ is the covariance between the returns of assets $i$ and $j$. By adjusting the weights $w_i$ appropriately across different low-correlation assets, SAMA aims to minimize the overall portfolio risk.

The fund’s prudent investment philosophy reflects a broader commitment to ensuring stable, long-term returns. This approach not only underscores the necessity of protecting national wealth but also demonstrates adaptability in leveraging financial expertise and market insights, allowing SAMA to navigate complex global financial landscapes effectively.

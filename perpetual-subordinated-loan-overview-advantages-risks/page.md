## What is a perpetual subordinated loan?

A perpetual subordinated loan is a type of loan that never needs to be paid back. It's called "perpetual" because it lasts forever, and "subordinated" because if the borrower goes bankrupt, this loan gets paid back after other debts.

These loans are often used by banks and big companies. They can be a good way for a company to get money without having to worry about paying it back. But, they usually have to pay interest on the loan forever. This interest payment can be a lot of money over time.

## How does a perpetual subordinated loan differ from other types of loans?

A perpetual subordinated loan is different from other loans because it never has to be paid back. Most loans have a set time when they need to be paid back, like a car loan or a mortgage. But with a perpetual loan, the borrower doesn't have to worry about returning the principal amount. Instead, they just keep paying interest on it forever. This can be good for the borrower because they don't have to plan for a big payment at the end, but it means they have to keep paying interest for as long as the loan exists.

Another difference is that perpetual subordinated loans are "subordinated." This means that if the borrower goes bankrupt, these loans get paid back after other debts. Other types of loans, like senior loans, get paid back first. So, perpetual subordinated loans are riskier for the lender because they might not get their money back if the borrower has a lot of other debts. Because of this, the interest rates on these loans are often higher to make up for the extra risk.

## Who typically issues perpetual subordinated loans?

Banks and big companies usually issue perpetual subordinated loans. These loans help them get money without having to pay it back. This can be good for them because they don't have to worry about a big payment at the end. Instead, they just keep paying interest on the loan forever.

These loans are often used by banks to meet certain rules about how much money they need to have. Big companies might use them to get money for big projects or to grow their business. Because these loans are risky for the people who lend the money, the interest rates are usually higher. This makes the loans more attractive to investors who are willing to take on more risk for a bigger reward.

## What are the main advantages of perpetual subordinated loans for issuers?

Perpetual subordinated loans are good for issuers because they never have to pay back the money they borrow. This means they don't have to worry about saving up for a big payment at the end of the loan. Instead, they just keep paying interest on the loan forever. This can be really helpful for banks and big companies because it gives them a way to get money without the stress of paying it back.

Another advantage is that these loans help banks meet certain rules about how much money they need to have. Banks have to keep a certain amount of money on hand, and perpetual subordinated loans count toward that amount. This makes it easier for banks to follow the rules and keep their business running smoothly. For big companies, these loans can provide the money they need for big projects or to grow their business without worrying about paying back the principal.

## What benefits do investors gain from perpetual subordinated loans?

Investors who buy perpetual subordinated loans get a steady stream of interest payments. Since the loan lasts forever, the interest keeps coming in as long as the issuer can pay it. This can be a good way for investors to get regular income from their investment without having to worry about the loan being paid back all at once.

Another benefit for investors is that these loans usually offer higher interest rates. Because they are riskier - they get paid back last if the issuer goes bankrupt - investors get a higher reward for taking on that risk. This can make perpetual subordinated loans attractive to investors who are looking for higher returns and are willing to accept more risk.

## What are the key risks associated with investing in perpetual subordinated loans?

One big risk of investing in perpetual subordinated loans is that they are the last to get paid back if the issuer goes bankrupt. This means if the company or bank that issued the loan runs into big trouble, investors might not get their money back. Other debts get paid first, so there might not be anything left for the people who invested in these loans. This makes them riskier than other types of loans.

Another risk is that the interest payments might stop. Even though the loan lasts forever, the issuer can sometimes choose to stop paying interest, especially if they are having financial problems. This can leave investors without the regular income they were expecting. Because of these risks, investors need to be careful and think about whether the higher interest rates are worth the chance of losing their money.

## How is the interest rate determined for perpetual subordinated loans?

The [interest rate](/wiki/interest-rate-trading-strategies) for perpetual subordinated loans is set based on how risky the loan is. Since these loans are the last to get paid back if the issuer goes bankrupt, they are seen as riskier than other types of loans. Because of this, the interest rate is usually higher to make up for the extra risk. The rate is also influenced by the overall market conditions and the creditworthiness of the issuer. If the issuer is seen as more likely to have financial problems, the interest rate will be higher to attract investors.

When setting the interest rate, the issuer and investors also look at what other similar loans are offering. If other perpetual subordinated loans are paying a certain rate, the new loan will need to be competitive to attract investors. This means the interest rate can change over time as market conditions and the issuer's financial health change. Overall, the interest rate is a balance between the risk the investors are taking and the need to make the loan attractive enough for people to invest in it.

## Can perpetual subordinated loans be called or redeemed by the issuer, and under what conditions?

Yes, perpetual subordinated loans can be called or redeemed by the issuer, but there are certain conditions they have to follow. The issuer might have the option to buy back the loan after a certain period of time, like 5 or 10 years. This is called a call option. If they decide to call the loan, they have to pay back the investors the amount they invested.

The conditions for calling the loan are usually set when the loan is first issued. The issuer might decide to call the loan if interest rates go down, so they can issue new loans at a lower rate. But, they can only do this if it's allowed by the terms of the loan. Investors need to know about these conditions before they invest, so they understand when the loan might be called and what it means for their investment.

## How do perpetual subordinated loans affect the issuer's balance sheet and capital structure?

Perpetual subordinated loans can help the issuer's balance sheet by adding to their capital without needing to pay back the principal. This means the issuer can show more money on their balance sheet, which can make them look stronger financially. For banks, these loans count as part of their capital, which helps them meet rules about how much money they need to have. This can make it easier for banks to do business and grow.

These loans also change the issuer's capital structure by adding a layer of debt that is treated like equity. Because the loan lasts forever and only needs interest payments, it acts more like owning a part of the company than a regular loan. This can be good for the issuer because it gives them more flexibility in how they manage their money. But, it also means they have to keep paying interest forever, which can be a big cost over time.

## What role do perpetual subordinated loans play in regulatory capital requirements?

Perpetual subordinated loans help banks meet the rules about how much money they need to have. These rules are called regulatory capital requirements. Banks have to keep a certain amount of money on hand to make sure they can handle problems and keep their customers' money safe. Perpetual subordinated loans count as part of this money because they are like a type of capital that doesn't need to be paid back. This makes it easier for banks to follow the rules and keep their business running smoothly.

These loans are seen as a type of capital because they last forever and only need interest payments. This makes them different from regular loans that need to be paid back. Because of this, banks can use perpetual subordinated loans to show they have enough money to meet the regulatory requirements. It helps banks manage their money better and stay strong financially, even though they have to keep paying interest on these loans forever.

## How have perpetual subordinated loans been used historically, and how has their use evolved?

Perpetual subordinated loans have been around for a long time. They were first used by big companies and banks to get money without having to pay it back. These loans were popular because they helped issuers keep more money on their balance sheets and meet rules about how much money they needed to have. For example, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, banks in Europe used these loans to strengthen their financial position and support growth.

Over time, the use of perpetual subordinated loans has changed. In recent years, they have become more important for banks because of stricter rules about how much money banks need to keep on hand. These loans help banks meet these rules while still getting the money they need to run their business. Also, more investors have started to see these loans as a good way to get regular income, even though they are riskier. This has made perpetual subordinated loans a key part of how banks and big companies manage their money today.

## What are some notable examples of perpetual subordinated loans and their outcomes?

One famous example of a perpetual subordinated loan is the one issued by the Bank of England in 1889. They needed money to help the economy, so they issued a loan that would never have to be paid back. Instead, they promised to pay interest on it forever. This loan helped the bank stay strong and support the economy. Over time, the interest payments became a regular part of the bank's expenses, but it was worth it because it helped them meet their goals.

Another example is from the 2000s when many big banks in Europe started using perpetual subordinated loans to meet new rules about how much money they needed to have. One bank, Deutsche Bank, issued these loans to show they had enough money to keep their business running safely. The loans helped the bank meet the rules, but they also had to keep paying interest on them. This made the loans a bit expensive over time, but it was a way for the bank to get the money they needed without having to pay it back.

## How do the tax strategies of Betterment and Wealthfront differ?

Betterment and Wealthfront both have smart ways to help you save money on taxes. Betterment uses a strategy called tax-loss harvesting.

Betterment also lets you pick how often they do this, so you can decide if you want them to check for tax-saving opportunities every day or just a few times a year. This can help you save more money, especially if you have a lot invested.

Wealthfront also uses tax-loss harvesting, but they do it a bit differently. They check for tax-saving opportunities every day automatically, so you don't have to do anything. Wealthfront also has something called "direct indexing," which can help you save even more on taxes. With direct indexing, instead of buying ETFs, they buy the actual stocks that make up the ETFs. This gives them more chances to find tax losses. Both companies want to help you keep more of your money, but Wealthfront's daily checks and direct indexing might save you a bit more on taxes.

## How can one manage and customize a portfolio?

Wealthfront provides investors with significant customization capabilities, such as Risk Parity and advanced tax optimization, which differentiates it from many competitors. Risk Parity is designed to optimize the risk-reward balance by allocating investments across various asset classes so that each contributes equally to the portfolio's risk. This strategy can be mathematically represented by minimizing the portfolio's variance subject to risk parity constraints, ensuring that each asset class contributes equally to overall risk. The formula for portfolio variance is:

$$
\sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_i w_j \sigma_{ij}
$$

where $w_i$ and $w_j$ are the weights of the assets in the portfolio, and $\sigma_{ij}$ is the covariance between assets $i$ and $j$.

Betterment, on the other hand, offers Flexible Portfolios that allow investors to adjust the weights of asset classes within their portfolios while still maintaining a diversified strategy. This flexibility enables investors to tailor their portfolios according to their risk tolerance or financial goals. Both Wealthfront and Betterment apply automatic rebalancing, which involves realigning the portfolio's asset allocation to conform with a predetermined strategy. This often happens when the proportion of different assets shifts due to market movements.

For instance, in Python, automatic rebalancing can be illustrated with a simple script to adjust asset weights back to target allocations:

```python
def rebalance_portfolio(current_weights, target_weights, asset_prices):
    current_value = sum(w * p for w, p in zip(current_weights, asset_prices))
    target_value = sum(tw * current_value for tw in target_weights)

    new_weights = [tv / p for tv, p in zip(target_value, asset_prices)]
    return new_weights

current_weights = [0.4, 0.6]
target_weights = [0.5, 0.5]
asset_prices = [100, 150]

adjusted_weights = rebalance_portfolio(current_weights, target_weights, asset_prices)
```

With this approach, any drift from the original allocation due to asset performance is corrected, thus adhering to the desired level of risk and investment strategy. Wealthfront and Betterment both enable investors to benefit from these systematic rebalancing practices, making it easier to achieve consistent investment outcomes over time.

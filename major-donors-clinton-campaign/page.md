## What role did bundlers play in securing major donations for the Clinton campaign?

Bundlers were really important for the Clinton campaign. They helped get big donations by asking their friends and business partners to give money.

They used their connections to help the campaign.

The bundlers made a big difference because they helped the Clinton campaign reach more people who could give big donations. For example, a bundler might ask 20 of their rich friends to each give $10,000. That would be $200,000 that the campaign could use. This was a smart way to get more money. The bundlers were like helpers who made it easier for the campaign to get the money it needed to do things like TV ads and travel. Without bundlers, the campaign might not have been able to raise as much money.

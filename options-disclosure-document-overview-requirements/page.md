## How often must the Options Disclosure Document be updated?

The people who make the rules, like the financial authorities, decide when these updates need to happen. They want to make sure that everyone has the latest information to make good choices.

## What are the regulatory requirements for the Options Disclosure Document?

It's like having a helper that makes sure everything is done right.

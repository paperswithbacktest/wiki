## What criticisms or limitations are associated with the Harvard MBA Index?

Some people say the Harvard MBA Index has problems. One big problem is that it only looks at Harvard graduates. This means it can't be used to compare Harvard with other schools.

Another issue is that the index focuses on things like jobs and money. It might not show other important parts of the MBA experience, like how much students learn or how they grow as people. Some people think the index should look at more than just careers and salaries to really show how good the program is.

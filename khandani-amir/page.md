The primary goal is to leverage complex mathematical models and formulas to make high-speed decisions, whereby human emotions and errors are minimized or eliminated in the trading process.

The mechanics of algorithmic trading operate through a set of rules encoded in algorithms, which can process vast amounts of data rapidly and execute trades at optimal conditions. A typical algorithmic trading strategy might involve [arbitrage](/wiki/arbitrage), [market making](/wiki/market-making), or [trend following](/wiki/trend-following), often using statistical analysis or machine learning models to find patterns or signals within the market.

A simple example code in Python using pandas and NumPy could illustrate the moving average strategy:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Suppose 'data' is a pandas DataFrame containing stock prices.
# Calculate the moving average
def moving_average_strategy(data, window_size):
    data['Moving Average'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=window_size).mean()
    data['Signal'] = 0  # Default signal is 0, or "do nothing"
    data['Signal'][window_size:] = np.where(data['Close'][window_size:] > data['Moving Average'][window_size:], 1, -1)
    return data

# Apply to data
strategy_data = moving_average_strategy(data, 20)  # 20-day moving average
```

The benefits of algorithmic trading include improved speed and accuracy in trading operations and the ability to backtest strategies against historical data to evaluate performance. These systems can manage orders with split-second precision, thereby enhancing [liquidity](/wiki/liquidity-risk-premium) and narrowing spreads in the market. However, algorithmic trading is also associated with several risks, such as system failures, flawed algorithms, and increased market [volatility](/wiki/volatility-trading-strategies), often referred to as "flash crashes."

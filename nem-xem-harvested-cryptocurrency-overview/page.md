## What is NEM (XEM) and what makes it unique among cryptocurrencies?

NEM, also known as XEM, is a cryptocurrency that was launched in 2015. It was created to improve upon some of the limitations found in other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. NEM uses a unique system called "Proof of Importance" to choose which users get to add new transactions to the blockchain. This system rewards users who are active and have many transactions with other users, instead of just rewarding those who have powerful computers.

One thing that makes NEM unique is its focus on being easy to use and customize. NEM has a tool called Mosaics, which lets users create their own custom tokens on the NEM blockchain. These tokens can represent anything from loyalty points to shares in a company. NEM also has a feature called Namespaces, which lets users create their own branded subdomains on the blockchain. These features make NEM a versatile platform that can be used for many different purposes beyond just sending and receiving money.

## How does the NEM blockchain work?

The NEM blockchain works by using a system called "Proof of Importance" to choose which users get to add new transactions to the blockchain. Instead of rewarding users who have the most powerful computers, like Bitcoin does, NEM rewards users who are active and have many transactions with other users. This means that the more you use NEM and interact with others, the more likely you are to be chosen to add new transactions and earn rewards.

When someone wants to send NEM (XEM) to another person, they create a transaction and send it to the network. The network then checks if the transaction is valid and if the sender has enough NEM to make the transaction. If everything is okay, the transaction is added to a block, and this block is added to the blockchain. Each block is linked to the previous block, creating a chain of blocks that keeps a record of all transactions. This makes sure that once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it can't be changed or deleted, making NEM a secure way to send and receive money.

## What is the role of XEM in the NEM ecosystem?

XEM is the main currency used in the NEM ecosystem. It's like the money that people use to buy things or send to each other. When you want to use the special features of NEM, like creating your own tokens with Mosaics or setting up your own branded subdomains with Namespaces, you need to use XEM to pay for these services. This makes XEM very important because it's what keeps the whole NEM system running.

XEM also plays a big role in keeping the NEM blockchain secure and working well. When people want to add new transactions to the blockchain, they need to have XEM. The more XEM you have and the more you use it to send and receive, the more likely you are to be chosen to add new transactions. This is because NEM uses a system called "Proof of Importance" that rewards active users. So, XEM is not just money in the NEM world; it's also what helps make sure the system stays fair and secure.

## What is harvesting in NEM and how does it differ from mining?

Harvesting in NEM is like mining in other cryptocurrencies, but it works differently. In NEM, instead of using powerful computers to solve hard math problems like in Bitcoin mining, harvesting is about being active on the network. When you have XEM and use it to send and receive transactions with other people, you become important in the NEM system. The more active and connected you are, the more likely you are to be chosen to add new transactions to the blockchain and earn XEM as a reward. This process is called harvesting.

The big difference between harvesting and mining is how they choose who gets to add new transactions. Mining rewards people with the best computers, which can be expensive and use a lot of electricity. Harvesting, on the other hand, rewards people who are active and have a lot of transactions with others. This makes NEM more fair because anyone can participate without needing special equipment. It also makes the network more secure because it encourages more people to use and stay active on the NEM blockchain.

## How can someone start harvesting XEM?

To start harvesting XEM, you need to have some XEM in your wallet. You can buy XEM from a [cryptocurrency](/wiki/cryptocurrency) exchange or receive it from someone else. Once you have XEM, you need to keep it in a NEM-compatible wallet, like the official NEM wallet called NanoWallet. Make sure your wallet is set up for harvesting by choosing the "harvesting" option and entering your wallet password.

After setting up your wallet, you need to be active on the NEM network. This means sending and receiving XEM with other people. The more you use your XEM, the more important you become in the NEM system. When you're important enough, the NEM network might choose you to add new transactions to the blockchain. If you're chosen, you get to keep some of the XEM from the transactions you add, which is how you earn more XEM through harvesting.

## What are the system requirements for harvesting XEM?

To start harvesting XEM, you don't need a fancy computer. You just need a regular computer that can run the NEM wallet. The wallet is called NanoWallet, and it works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You also need to have some XEM in your wallet. You can get XEM by buying it from a cryptocurrency exchange or by receiving it from someone else.

Once you have the wallet set up and some XEM in it, you need to be active on the NEM network. This means you should send and receive XEM with other people. The more you use your XEM, the more important you become in the NEM system. When you're important enough, the NEM network might pick you to add new transactions to the blockchain. If you get picked, you earn more XEM as a reward.

## What are the potential rewards and costs associated with harvesting XEM?

Harvesting XEM can earn you more XEM as a reward. When the NEM network picks you to add new transactions to the blockchain, you get to keep some of the XEM from those transactions. The more active you are on the network, the more likely you are to be chosen and the more XEM you can earn. It's like getting paid for helping to keep the NEM system running smoothly.

The costs of harvesting XEM are pretty low. You don't need to buy special computers or use a lot of electricity like you do with Bitcoin mining. You just need a regular computer and some XEM to start. The only real cost is the time you spend sending and receiving XEM to stay active on the network. But since you can do this from your regular computer, it's not expensive at all.

## How does the Proof of Importance (PoI) algorithm work in NEM?

The Proof of Importance (PoI) algorithm in NEM is a special way to decide who gets to add new transactions to the blockchain. Instead of [picking](/wiki/asset-class-picking) people who have the most powerful computers, like Bitcoin does, NEM chooses people who are active and have many transactions with others. This means that the more you use NEM to send and receive XEM, the more important you become in the system. When you're important enough, the NEM network might pick you to add new transactions and you get to keep some XEM as a reward.

PoI looks at two main things to figure out how important you are: how much XEM you have and how you use it. If you have a lot of XEM but don't use it, you won't be very important. But if you have some XEM and you're always sending and receiving it with other people, you'll be seen as more important. This system makes NEM fair because anyone can participate without needing special equipment, and it encourages people to stay active on the network, making it more secure and lively.

## What are the security features of the NEM blockchain?

The NEM blockchain has strong security features to keep it safe. It uses a system called Proof of Importance to pick who gets to add new transactions. This system makes it hard for one person to control the whole network because it rewards people who are active and have many transactions with others. This way, more people are involved in keeping the blockchain secure, making it harder for bad actors to mess with it.

Another important security feature is the way NEM checks transactions. Before a transaction is added to the blockchain, the network makes sure it's valid and that the sender has enough XEM. Once a transaction is added, it's locked in place and can't be changed or deleted. This makes sure that once you send or receive XEM, it's safe and secure.

## How does NEM support smart contracts and what are their capabilities?

NEM supports smart contracts through a feature called "APIs" (Application Programming Interfaces). These APIs let developers create special programs that can run on the NEM blockchain. These programs can do things like automatically send XEM when certain conditions are met, or manage custom tokens created with Mosaics. This makes it easy for people to set up rules and agreements that the blockchain will follow without needing a middleman.

The smart contracts on NEM are not as complex as those on some other blockchains like Ethereum, but they are designed to be simple and easy to use. They can handle basic tasks like sending payments or managing tokens, which is great for businesses and organizations that want to use blockchain technology without getting too complicated. This focus on simplicity and ease of use makes NEM a good choice for people who want to use smart contracts without needing to learn a lot of technical stuff.

## What are some real-world applications of NEM?

NEM can be used for many things in the real world. One cool way people use NEM is for loyalty programs. Imagine you have a favorite store, and they give you points every time you shop there. With NEM, those points can be turned into special tokens called Mosaics. You can use these tokens to get discounts or rewards, and they're safe because they're on the blockchain. This makes it easy for businesses to set up loyalty programs without needing a lot of complicated systems.

Another way NEM is used is for supply chain management. Companies can use NEM to keep track of their products from the factory to the store. Each time a product moves, a new transaction is added to the blockchain, so everyone can see where it's been and where it's going. This helps make sure that products are safe and that no one is cheating. It's like having a digital paper trail that everyone can trust.

## What are the future developments and upgrades planned for NEM?

NEM is always working on making its system better. One big thing they're doing is called Catapult. Catapult is a new version of the NEM blockchain that will make it faster and able to handle more transactions. It's like upgrading from a small road to a big highway. This will help NEM work better for businesses and other big users who need to do a lot of transactions quickly.

Another thing NEM is working on is making it easier for people to use their platform. They want to make the tools and features simpler so that more people can use NEM without needing to be experts in blockchain technology. This includes making the wallet easier to use and adding more ways for people to create and manage their own tokens and smart contracts. By doing this, NEM hopes to grow its community and be used for even more things in the future.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assume 'data' is a DataFrame with historical stock prices
data['20_SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['50_SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Buy Signal: When 20-day SMA crosses above the 50-day SMA
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['20_SMA'] > data['50_SMA']) & (data['20_SMA'].shift(1) <= data['50_SMA'].shift(1))

# Sell Signal: When 20-day SMA crosses below the 50-day SMA
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['20_SMA'] < data['50_SMA']) & (data['20_SMA'].shift(1) >= data['50_SMA'].shift(1))
```

Such strategies exemplify how RJ may apply algorithmic principles to enhance trading efficiency.

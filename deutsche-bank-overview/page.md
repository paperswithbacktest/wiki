## How has Deutsche Bank's strategy evolved over the last decade?

They used to focus on many different things, but they realized they needed to focus more on what they do best. So, they decided to work more on investment banking and helping big companies with their money. This meant they had to cut down on some other parts of their business that were not making as much money. They also started to use more technology to make their services better and faster.

Another big change was that Deutsche Bank started to be more careful with their money. They wanted to make sure they were not taking too many risks.

They also had to pay for not following rules about how they could trade and invest money. These fines cost them a lot of money and made it harder for them to make a profit.

Deutsche Bank works hard to manage risk and follow all the rules. They have special teams that watch over the bank's activities to make sure everything is done the right way. These teams check that the bank is not taking too many risks with its money and that it's following all the laws and rules in the places where it works. They use computer systems to keep track of what's going on and to spot any problems early. This helps them to fix things before they become big issues.

To make sure they are doing a good job, Deutsche Bank also trains its employees a lot. They teach them about the rules they need to follow and how to do their jobs without taking too many risks.

By doing all these things, Deutsche Bank tries to keep its customers' money safe and make sure it's always following the law.

## What technological innovations has Deutsche Bank implemented?

This platform helps customers check their money, move it around, and even invest it without going to a bank branch. They also use special computer programs to help them make better decisions about where to put their money and how to help their customers.

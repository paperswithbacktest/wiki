## What is the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)?

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is a private, non-profit organization in the United States that focuses on economic research. It was founded in 1920 and is known for studying how the economy works and how it changes over time. The NBER does not make policy or tell the government what to do. Instead, it helps everyone understand the economy better by doing careful research and sharing what it learns.

One of the most important things the NBER does is figure out when the United States is in a recession or not. A recession is a time when the economy is not doing well, and people might lose jobs or have less money. The NBER looks at a lot of information, like how many people are working and how much they are spending, to decide if a recession is happening. When they say a recession has started or ended, it helps everyone know what is going on with the economy.

## When was the NBER founded and by whom?

The National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER, was founded in 1920. It was started by a man named Wesley Clair Mitchell. He was an economist who wanted to learn more about how the economy works and how it changes over time.

Wesley Clair Mitchell believed that by studying the economy carefully, we could understand it better. He thought that this understanding could help everyone, not just the government or big businesses. So, he created the NBER as a place where economists could do this important work.

## What is the primary mission of the NBER?

The main goal of the National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER, is to learn more about the economy and how it changes over time. They want to understand how things like jobs, money, and spending work together. The NBER does this by doing careful research and looking at a lot of information. They don't tell the government what to do or make any policies. Instead, they focus on figuring out what is happening in the economy and sharing that knowledge with everyone.

One important part of the NBER's mission is to figure out when the United States is in a recession. A recession is a time when the economy is not doing well, and people might lose their jobs or have less money. The NBER looks at things like how many people are working and how much they are spending to decide if a recession is happening. When they say a recession has started or ended, it helps everyone understand what is going on with the economy.

## How does the NBER define a recession?

The National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER, says a recession is a time when the economy is not doing well. They look at a lot of information to decide if a recession is happening. They don't just use one thing, like how many people are working or how much they are spending. Instead, they look at many things together to see if the economy is getting worse.

The NBER doesn't say a recession is happening just because the economy has been bad for two quarters in a row, which some people think. They want to see a big drop in the economy that lasts for a while. When they see this, they say a recession has started. When the economy starts to get better, they say the recession has ended.

## What are some key research areas that the NBER focuses on?

The National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER, studies many different parts of the economy. They look at things like how people spend their money, how businesses work, and how the government affects the economy. They also study big topics like how the whole world's economy is doing and how countries trade with each other. The NBER wants to understand all these things to help everyone know more about the economy.

Another important area the NBER focuses on is figuring out why some people have more money than others. They study things like jobs, education, and where people live to see why some people are rich and others are poor. They also look at how laws and policies can help make things more fair for everyone. By doing this research, the NBER hopes to help make the economy better for all people.

## How does the NBER influence economic policy?

The National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER, does not make economic policy itself. Instead, it helps shape policy by doing careful research and sharing what it learns. When the NBER studies the economy, it looks at things like jobs, spending, and how the economy is doing overall. They share their findings in reports and papers that anyone can read. This information helps people who make laws and policies understand what is happening in the economy.

For example, when the NBER says a recession has started or ended, it can influence what the government does next. If the NBER says the economy is in a recession, the government might decide to spend more money or change laws to help people. On the other hand, if the NBER says the recession is over, the government might change its plans to help the economy grow in different ways. By providing clear and trusted information, the NBER helps guide the people who make economic policy.

## Who are some notable economists associated with the NBER?

Many famous economists have worked with the National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER. One of them is Milton Friedman. He was a big name in economics and won a Nobel Prize for his work. He studied things like how much money is in the economy and how it affects things like jobs and prices. Another important economist is Paul Samuelson. He also won a Nobel Prize and helped create new ways to think about how the economy works. He wrote a famous book that many students still use to learn economics.

Another notable economist associated with the NBER is Robert Solow. He won a Nobel Prize for his work on how technology and growth in the economy are connected. His ideas helped people understand why some countries get richer faster than others. Claudia Goldin is another important economist at the NBER. She studies how women's roles in the economy have changed over time and how this affects things like jobs and pay. Her work has helped people see why it's important to think about fairness and equality in the economy.

These economists and others like them have helped the NBER become a trusted place for learning about the economy. Their research has changed the way people think about economic problems and has helped guide people who make laws and policies. By working with the NBER, these economists have made a big difference in how we understand and improve the economy.

## What is the role of the NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee?

The NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee is a group of people who look at the economy to figure out when a recession starts and ends. They do this by studying a lot of information, like how many people are working, how much money people are spending, and how well businesses are doing. They don't just use one thing to decide if there's a recession. Instead, they look at everything together to see if the economy is getting worse or better.

When the Business Cycle Dating Committee says a recession has started or ended, it helps everyone know what's happening with the economy. This is important because it can guide what the government does next. For example, if they say the economy is in a recession, the government might decide to spend more money or change laws to help people. If they say the recession is over, the government might change its plans to help the economy grow in different ways. By telling everyone when a recession is happening, the committee helps make sure the economy is understood and managed well.

## How is the NBER funded and what is its organizational structure?

The National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER, gets its money from different places. It is a non-profit group, so it doesn't make money like a business. Instead, it gets money from grants, which are like gifts from the government or other groups that want to help with research. It also gets money from people and businesses that want to support its work. This way, the NBER can keep doing its research without having to worry about making a profit.

The NBER is set up in a way that helps it do its research well. It has a board of directors, which is a group of people who make big decisions for the organization. They help decide what the NBER should study and how it should spend its money. The NBER also has different groups of researchers who focus on specific parts of the economy, like jobs or how people spend money. These groups work together to learn more about the economy and share what they find with everyone.

## What are some major publications or reports released by the NBER?

The National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER, puts out a lot of important reports and papers. One big thing they do is release working papers. These are like early versions of research that economists share with others. They cover all sorts of topics, like how people spend money, how businesses work, and what's happening with the economy around the world. Anyone can read these working papers on the NBER's website, which helps spread new ideas and knowledge.

Another important thing the NBER does is put out reports about when a recession starts and ends. The Business Cycle Dating Committee, a group of people at the NBER, looks at a lot of information to decide if the economy is in a recession. When they make their decision, they write a report explaining why they think a recession has started or ended. These reports are very important because they help everyone know what's going on with the economy and can guide what the government does next.

The NBER also publishes [books](/wiki/algo-trading-books) and conference volumes. These are collections of research on big topics in economics. They often come from meetings where economists get together to talk about their work. These books help bring together a lot of knowledge in one place, which can help other researchers and people who make laws and policies understand the economy better.

## How does the NBER collaborate with other institutions globally?

The National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER, works with other groups around the world to learn more about the economy. They do this by joining projects with other research groups and universities. For example, they might work with economists from different countries to study how trade affects jobs and money. By working together, they can share ideas and information that help everyone understand the economy better. This teamwork also helps the NBER learn about how the economy works in different parts of the world.

The NBER also holds meetings and conferences with other groups. These events bring together economists from all over to talk about their research. They might discuss big topics like how to make the economy grow or how to help people who don't have much money. By sharing what they know at these meetings, the NBER and other groups can learn from each other and come up with new ideas. This helps make their research better and helps everyone understand the economy more clearly.

## What are the criticisms or controversies surrounding the NBER's methodologies and findings?

Some people have criticized the National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER, for how they decide when a recession starts and ends. They say the NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee takes too long to say a recession has started. By the time the NBER says it, people already know the economy is not doing well. This can make it hard for the government to help people quickly. Also, some people think the NBER looks at too many things to decide if there's a recession. They say it would be easier if the NBER just used one thing, like how much the economy has shrunk over a few months.

Another criticism is about the NBER's research. Some people think the NBER's studies are too hard to understand. They say the NBER should explain their findings in a simpler way so more people can learn from them. There are also questions about who pays for the NBER's research. Some people worry that if the NBER gets money from businesses or the government, it might affect what they study or what they find. They want the NBER to be clear about where their money comes from and how it might affect their work.

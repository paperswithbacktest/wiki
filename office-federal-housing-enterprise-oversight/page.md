## What are the challenges faced by OFHEO in regulating housing enterprises?

OFHEO faced some big challenges in watching over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These companies were very big and important in the housing market. They had a lot of money and power, so it was hard for OFHEO to make sure they followed all the rules. Sometimes, the companies would make mistakes in their financial reports, which made it tough for OFHEO to see if they were safe and sound. OFHEO had to be very careful and thorough in checking everything to make sure the companies were doing things the right way.

Another challenge was that the housing market could change a lot. When the market was doing well, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac might take more risks to make more money.

## How does OFHEO interact with other federal agencies?

HUD helps people find homes and makes rules about housing. OFHEO and HUD would share information to make sure the housing market was stable. They would talk about any problems they saw and work together to fix them. This was important because if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had big problems, it could affect a lot of people trying to buy homes.

OFHEO also worked with the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve helps control the country's money and makes sure the economy is stable. OFHEO would share information with the Federal Reserve about how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were doing. This helped the Federal Reserve understand the housing market better and make good decisions. By working together, these agencies could help keep the housing market safe and make sure people could buy homes without big problems.

## What was the impact of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 on OFHEO?

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 had a big impact on OFHEO. This law changed things a lot for OFHEO. It made a new agency called the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The FHFA took over all the jobs that OFHEO used to do. This meant that OFHEO was no longer in charge of watching over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FHFA got more power and more responsibilities to help keep the housing market safe.

The change was important because it happened during a time when the housing market was having big problems. The new FHFA was set up to be stronger and better at watching over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This was meant to help fix the problems in the housing market and make sure things were more stable. So, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 ended OFHEO and started a new chapter with the FHFA.

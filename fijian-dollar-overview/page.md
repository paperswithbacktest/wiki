## How has the value of the Fijian Dollar changed over the past decade?

Over the past decade, the value of the Fijian Dollar has gone up and down compared to major currencies like the US Dollar and the Euro. At the start of the decade, around 2013, 1 Fijian Dollar was worth about 0.55 US Dollars. By 2023, the value had dropped to around 0.45 US Dollars. This means that over the years, the Fijian Dollar became less valuable compared to the US Dollar. The changes in value were influenced by things like Fiji's economy, tourism, and global events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

When looking at the Euro, the Fijian Dollar also saw changes over the decade. In 2013, 1 Fijian Dollar was worth about 0.42 Euros. By 2023, this had dropped to around 0.41 Euros. The change was not as big as with the US Dollar, but it still shows that the Fijian Dollar lost a bit of its value against the Euro. Factors like trade, inflation, and economic policies in both Fiji and Europe played a role in these changes.

## What factors influence the value of the Fijian Dollar?

The value of the Fijian Dollar changes because of many things. One big reason is how well Fiji's economy is doing. If Fiji makes a lot of money from things like tourism and selling sugar, the Fijian Dollar can become more valuable. But if the economy is not doing well, the Fijian Dollar might lose value. Another reason is what other countries think about Fiji's money. If people believe that Fiji's economy will do well in the future, they might want to buy more Fijian Dollars, which makes it more valuable.

Global events also play a big role in the value of the Fijian Dollar. Things like the COVID-19 pandemic can hurt tourism, which is very important for Fiji's economy. When fewer people come to visit, the Fijian Dollar can lose value. Also, changes in the world's economy, like how much other countries are trading or what their interest rates are, can affect the Fijian Dollar. The Reserve Bank of Fiji tries to manage all these things to keep the Fijian Dollar stable, but it's not always easy.

## How does the Fijian Dollar's performance compare to other Pacific Island currencies?

The Fijian Dollar's performance compared to other Pacific Island currencies can be different over time. For example, compared to the Samoan Tala, the Fijian Dollar has been stronger in recent years. One Fijian Dollar can buy more Samoan Tala now than it could a few years ago. This is because Fiji's economy is bigger and more people visit Fiji for tourism, which helps make the Fijian Dollar more valuable. On the other hand, the Tongan Pa'anga has been a bit weaker than the Fijian Dollar. This means if you have one Fijian Dollar, you can get more Tongan Pa'anga than before. The differences in these values come from how well each country's economy is doing and how much money people are spending there.

The Papua New Guinean Kina is another currency that the Fijian Dollar is compared to. The Fijian Dollar has been doing better than the Kina in recent times. This is because Papua New Guinea's economy has had some problems, like lower prices for the things they sell, like oil and gas. When a country's economy is not doing well, its money can lose value. The Fijian Dollar, however, has been more stable because Fiji has a strong tourism industry and gets money from other countries. All these things show that the Fijian Dollar's value can change a lot compared to other Pacific Island currencies, depending on what is happening in each country's economy.

## What are the economic policies affecting the Fijian Dollar?

The Fijian Dollar is affected by many economic policies set by the Reserve Bank of Fiji. One big policy is how the bank controls the amount of money in the country. If the bank thinks there is too much money, it can take steps to slow down how fast money is made. This can help keep the Fijian Dollar strong. Another policy is setting interest rates. When the Reserve Bank of Fiji changes the interest rates, it can make people want to save more or spend more. If interest rates go up, people might save more money, which can make the Fijian Dollar stronger. If interest rates go down, people might spend more, which can make the Fijian Dollar weaker.

The government of Fiji also has policies that affect the Fijian Dollar. For example, the government can decide to spend more money on things like building roads or schools. When the government spends more, it can help the economy grow, but it might also make the Fijian Dollar weaker if people think there is too much money being spent. The government can also make rules about trading with other countries. If Fiji sells more things to other countries, it can make the Fijian Dollar stronger. But if Fiji buys more things from other countries, it can make the Fijian Dollar weaker. All these policies work together to try and keep the Fijian Dollar stable and help the economy grow.

## How does the tourism industry impact the Fijian Dollar?

The tourism industry is very important for the Fijian Dollar. When lots of people visit Fiji for holidays, they spend money on things like hotels, food, and activities. This money helps make the Fijian economy stronger. When the economy is doing well because of tourism, the Fijian Dollar can become more valuable. More people want to buy Fijian Dollars to spend in Fiji, which makes the currency stronger.

But if fewer people come to Fiji, it can hurt the Fijian Dollar. If there is a big event like a global health crisis or a natural disaster, fewer tourists might visit. When this happens, less money comes into the country, and the Fijian Dollar can lose value. The government and the Reserve Bank of Fiji try to help by making rules and policies to keep the economy and the Fijian Dollar stable, even when tourism goes down.

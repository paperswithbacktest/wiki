## What is the Basel III Accord?

The Basel III Accord is a set of international banking regulations developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. It was created to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and risk management of banks after the 2008 financial crisis. The main goal of Basel III is to make banks more resilient and able to handle financial stress by setting higher standards for capital, liquidity, and leverage.

Basel III introduced stricter rules on how much capital banks must hold. Capital is the money banks have to cover losses. The accord requires banks to have more high-quality capital, like common equity, which can absorb losses better. It also set new rules for liquidity, which is about having enough cash or assets that can be quickly turned into cash. This helps banks manage short-term financial needs. Additionally, Basel III introduced a leverage ratio to limit how much debt banks can take on compared to their capital, reducing the risk of over-borrowing.

## What is a solvency ratio?

A solvency ratio is a number that shows if a company can pay its long-term debts. It tells us if the company has enough money and assets to keep going even if things get tough. Think of it like checking if someone has enough savings to cover their big loans, not just their monthly bills.

There are different kinds of solvency ratios, but they all help us see the big picture of a company's financial health. One common solvency ratio is the debt to equity ratio. It compares what the company owes (debt) to what the owners have put in (equity). If this ratio is high, it means the company relies a lot on borrowed money, which can be risky. A lower ratio means the company is using less debt and might be in a safer position financially.

## Why are solvency ratios important for banks?

Solvency ratios are really important for banks because they show if a bank can pay back its long-term debts. Banks borrow a lot of money to lend to others, so it's crucial to know if they can handle these big loans. If a bank's solvency ratios are good, it means they have enough money and assets to cover their debts, even if things go wrong. This makes people feel safer about keeping their money in the bank.

If a bank's solvency ratios are bad, it could mean trouble. It might not have enough money to pay back what it owes, which can scare people away. This can lead to a bank run, where everyone wants their money back at the same time, and the bank can't give it to them. That's why banks need to keep their solvency ratios strong. It helps them stay stable and keeps the trust of their customers and investors.

## What are the key solvency ratios under Basel III?

Under Basel III, one key solvency ratio is the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. This ratio looks at a bank's core capital, like common shares and retained earnings, compared to its risk-weighted assets. It's important because it shows how well a bank can handle losses using its own money. Basel III set a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, but many countries have higher requirements to make banks even safer.

Another important solvency ratio is the Tier 1 capital ratio. This includes CET1 capital plus other forms of Tier 1 capital, like non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. The Tier 1 capital ratio also compares this capital to the bank's risk-weighted assets. Basel III requires a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%, which helps ensure banks have enough strong capital to stay solvent during tough times.

The third key solvency ratio is the Total Capital Ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital can include things like subordinated debt and general loan-loss reserves. The Total Capital Ratio is also measured against risk-weighted assets, and Basel III sets a minimum of 8%. This ratio helps make sure banks have a broad base of capital to absorb losses and remain solvent.

## What is the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio required under Basel III?

The minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio required under Basel III is 4.5%. This ratio measures a bank's core capital, like common shares and retained earnings, against its risk-weighted assets. It's important because it shows how well a bank can handle losses using its own money. A higher CET1 ratio means the bank is in a stronger position to absorb losses and stay solvent.

However, many countries have set higher CET1 requirements to make their banks even safer. For example, some countries might require a CET1 ratio of 7% or more. These higher standards help ensure that banks can withstand financial stress and maintain the trust of their customers and investors.

## How does the Tier 1 capital ratio requirement differ from CET1 under Basel III?

The Tier 1 capital ratio and the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio are both important measures of a bank's financial strength under Basel III, but they include different types of capital. The CET1 ratio focuses on a bank's core capital, which includes common shares and retained earnings. This is the highest quality of capital because it can absorb losses without the bank having to stop operating. Basel III requires a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, which means banks must have at least 4.5% of their risk-weighted assets covered by this core capital.

The Tier 1 capital ratio, on the other hand, includes all the capital that counts towards the CET1 ratio, plus other forms of Tier 1 capital like non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. This makes the Tier 1 capital ratio a bit broader than the CET1 ratio. Under Basel III, the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio is set at 6%. This higher requirement helps ensure that banks have a strong base of capital to handle losses and remain solvent, even if they face tough financial times.

## What is the total capital ratio requirement under Basel III?

The total capital ratio is another important measure under Basel III. It includes all the capital that counts towards the Tier 1 capital ratio, plus Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital can include things like subordinated debt and general loan-loss reserves. The total capital ratio compares this broader base of capital to the bank's risk-weighted assets. Under Basel III, banks must have a total capital ratio of at least 8%.

This requirement makes sure banks have a wide range of capital to absorb losses and stay solvent. It helps banks handle financial stress better because they have different types of capital to fall back on. By having a higher total capital ratio, banks can show they are prepared for tough times and keep the trust of their customers and investors.

## How do the Basel III solvency ratio requirements compare to those of Basel II?

Basel III made the rules for banks tougher than they were in Basel II. Under Basel II, the minimum requirement for the Tier 1 capital ratio was 4%, and the total capital ratio was 8%. Basel III kept the total capital ratio at 8% but raised the Tier 1 capital ratio to 6%. This means banks now need more of the strong kind of capital, which is better at handling losses. Also, Basel III introduced a new ratio called the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, which wasn't in Basel II. The CET1 ratio has to be at least 4.5%, making sure banks have a lot of their own money to cover losses.

The changes in Basel III were made to make banks safer after the 2008 financial crisis. Basel II focused more on how banks managed their risks, but it didn't require as much high-quality capital as Basel III does. By increasing the requirements for Tier 1 and CET1 capital, Basel III aims to make sure banks can better handle financial stress. These stricter rules help protect banks and the whole financial system from big problems, making it more stable for everyone.

## What are the phase-in arrangements for Basel III solvency ratios?

The phase-in arrangements for Basel III solvency ratios were set up to give banks time to meet the new rules. Starting in 2013, banks had to slowly increase their capital to meet the new minimums. For example, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio had to reach 3.5% by 2013, then go up a little each year until it hit the full 4.5% by 2015. The Tier 1 capital ratio started at 4.5% in 2013 and had to reach 6% by 2015. The total capital ratio stayed at 8% but had to include more high-quality capital over time.

The phase-in also included something called capital conservation buffers. These are extra amounts of capital banks need to have on top of the minimums. The buffer for CET1 started at 0% in 2016 and went up by 0.625% each year until it reached 2.5% by 2019. So, by the end of the phase-in period, banks needed a CET1 ratio of at least 7% (4.5% minimum plus 2.5% buffer) to be fully compliant. This slow increase gave banks time to adjust their operations and build up their capital without causing too much disruption.

## How do banks calculate their risk-weighted assets under Basel III?

Banks calculate their risk-weighted assets under Basel III by looking at all their assets and figuring out how risky each one is. They do this by giving each asset a risk weight, which is a number that shows how likely it is for the asset to lose value. For example, cash is very safe, so it gets a low risk weight, like 0%. Loans to people with good credit might get a risk weight of 50%, while loans to people with bad credit might get a risk weight of 100% or more. Banks add up all their assets after multiplying each one by its risk weight to get the total risk-weighted assets.

This method helps banks see how much capital they need to cover the risks they are taking. If a bank has a lot of risky assets, its risk-weighted assets will be high, and it will need more capital to stay safe. Basel III makes sure banks use this calculation to set aside enough money to handle losses, making the whole financial system stronger and more stable.

## What are the implications of failing to meet Basel III solvency ratio requirements?

If a bank doesn't meet the Basel III solvency ratio requirements, it can face big problems. Regulators might step in and make the bank do things like stop paying dividends or bonuses, or even raise more money quickly. This is to make sure the bank has enough capital to cover its risks. If a bank keeps failing to meet these requirements, it could lose its license to operate, which means it would have to close down. This can shake people's trust in the bank and make them want to take their money out, leading to a bank run.

Failing to meet Basel III requirements can also hurt a bank's reputation. Customers and investors might start to worry about the bank's health and take their money elsewhere. This can make it harder for the bank to get new customers or borrow money. In the worst case, if many banks fail to meet these rules, it could cause problems for the whole financial system, making it harder for businesses and people to get loans and do their financial business. That's why it's so important for banks to follow these rules and keep their solvency ratios strong.

## How do global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) have different solvency ratio requirements under Basel III?

Global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) are big banks that can affect the whole world's economy if they get into trouble. Because of this, Basel III has special rules for them. G-SIBs have to hold more capital than other banks. On top of the regular Basel III requirements, they need an extra buffer called the G-SIB surcharge. This surcharge can be anywhere from 1% to 3.5% more of their Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, depending on how important the bank is to the global financial system. This extra capital helps make sure that if a G-SIB faces problems, it has enough money to handle the situation without causing a big mess for everyone else.

The idea behind these extra rules is to make G-SIBs stronger and safer. If a big bank fails, it can cause a lot of trouble for other banks and the economy. So, by making G-SIBs hold more capital, Basel III tries to lower the chance of this happening. This means G-SIBs need to keep their CET1 ratio higher than the regular minimum of 4.5%. For example, if a G-SIB has a 2% surcharge, it would need a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5% (4.5% regular minimum + 2% surcharge) to be fully compliant. These stricter rules help protect the global financial system and make sure big banks are ready for tough times.

## What are Basel III Solvency Ratios and how can they be understood?

Basel III requires banks to uphold a minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 8%, a pivotal measure reflecting a bank’s capital vis-à-vis its risk-weighted assets (RWA). This ratio is imperative for maintaining financial stability, enabling banks to meet unforeseen long-term debt obligations. The CAR is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{CAR} = \frac{\text{Total Capital}}{\text{Risk-Weighted Assets}} \times 100\%
$$

Risk-weighted assets are determined by evaluating the risk profile of various asset classes held by banks, ensuring that higher-risk assets require more capital to provide a buffer against potential losses. This ensures that banks have enough capital to absorb losses without collapsing, thereby promoting overall economic stability.

Basel III mandates two primary categories of capital: Tier 1 and Tier 2, which are integral to comprehending the capital adequacy framework.

**Tier 1 Capital** primarily serves as a bank’s core capital, designed to absorb losses while the bank remains a going concern. It is the most secure and reliable form of capital that includes:

- **Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1):** Comprising common shares, stock surplus, retained earnings, and other comprehensive income, CET1 is the highest quality of capital that banks must hold. Basel III requires CET1 to be at least 4.5% of RWA, ensuring a strong foundational buffer.

- **Additional Tier 1 Capital (AT1):** Consisting of non-cumulative preferred stock, contingent convertible securities, and other similar instruments, AT1 acts as supplementary shock absorbers for the bank’s solvency position.

**Tier 2 Capital** provides additional protection but is considered less secure than Tier 1. It acts as a buffer during winding down:

- **Subordinated Debt:** Debt that ranks lower than ordinary depositors and other senior debt holders in the event of a bank's liquidation.

- **Hybrid Instruments and Other Items:** Instruments that possess both debt and equity-like properties are included in this category.

The total capital under Basel III is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, ensuring that banks possess sufficient high-quality capital to withstand adverse conditions. By defining stringent regulations around capital adequacy, Basel III aspires to fortify the banking system against financial distress and enhance its resilience, especially during periods of financial instability.

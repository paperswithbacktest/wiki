Quantitative analysis based on AI (Artificial Intelligence) is gaining popularity among institutional traders for several reasons:

1. **Processing Large Quantities of Data**: AI, particularly machine learning, is particularly well suited to analyzing large datasets. Institutional traders can thus exploit complex market data and alternative data sources to find investment opportunities.
2. **More Accurate Predictions**: AI models can identify non-linear patterns and complex interactions between variables that would be difficult to detect with traditional analysis methods.
3. **Automation**: AI makes it possible to automate many aspects of trading, from finding opportunities to executing orders, which can lead to greater efficiency and reduce human error.
4. **Adaptability**: AI algorithms, particularly those based on deep learning, can adapt and evolve in response to new data, enabling greater responsiveness to market changes.
5. **Bias Reduction**: By leveraging data and algorithmic models, AI can help reduce certain behavioral biases that affect trading decisions.
6. **Complex strategies**: AI can manage multi-asset and multi-factor strategies with a complexity that would be difficult to manage manually.
7. **Diversification**: By using AI to explore various strategies and approaches, institutional traders can diversify their portfolios and potentially reduce risk.

However, it's important to note that AI also presents challenges and risks. Overfitting is a risk where an AI model performs well on historical data but fails under real market conditions. Furthermore, over-reliance on automated models can lead to systemic errors if these models are based on incorrect assumptions.

In conclusion, while AI-based quantitative analysis offers many advantages, it must be used judiciously and in combination with a solid understanding of the market and appropriate human oversight.

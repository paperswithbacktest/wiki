def reconcile_payments(payments_df, invoices_df):
    # Merge dataframes to find matching transactions
    reconciled_df = pd.merge(payments_df, invoices_df, on='transaction_id', how='inner')

    # Identify unmatched transactions
    unmatched_payments = payments_df[~payments_df['transaction_id'].isin(reconciled_df['transaction_id'])]
    unmatched_invoices = invoices_df[~invoices_df['transaction_id'].isin(reconciled_df['transaction_id'])]

    return reconciled_df, unmatched_payments, unmatched_invoices

# Example usage:
payments = pd.DataFrame({'transaction_id': [1, 2, 3], 'amount': [100, 200, 300]})
invoices = pd.DataFrame({'transaction_id': [2, 3, 4], 'amount': [200, 300, 400]})

reconciled, unmatched_p, unmatched_i = reconcile_payments(payments, invoices)

print("Reconciled Transactions:\n", reconciled)

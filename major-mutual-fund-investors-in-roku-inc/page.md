## What is a mutual fund?

A mutual fund is a type of investment where many people put their money together to buy a variety of stocks, bonds, or other assets. It's like a big basket where everyone's money is mixed and managed by a professional. This makes it easier for people to invest in a diverse range of things without having to pick each one themselves.

When you invest in a mutual fund, you buy shares of the fund. The value of your shares goes up or down based on how well the investments in the fund are doing. This can be a good way to grow your money over time, but it also comes with risks because the value can go down as well as up. Mutual funds are popular because they offer a way to invest in many different things at once, which can help spread out the risk.

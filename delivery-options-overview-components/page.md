Optimizing these choices requires complex logistic algorithms that can handle large datasets to predict delivery times and costs. For example, Python libraries like NumPy and pandas can be instrumental in analyzing data patterns and making informed logistics decisions.

To illustrate a possible approach, consider a basic Python script that estimates delivery times based on historical data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load historical delivery data
data = pd.read_csv('delivery_data.csv')

# Prepare the feature and target variables
X = data[['distance', 'delivery_option_code', 'traffic_conditions']]
y = data['delivery_time']

# Fit a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict delivery time for a new order
new_order = [[150, 2, 1]]  # Example input: 150 km, expedited delivery, moderate traffic
predicted_time = model.predict(new_order)

print(f"Estimated delivery time: {predicted_time[0]:.2f} hours")
```

This script uses a simple linear regression model to predict delivery times based on various factors like distance, delivery option, and traffic conditions. By leveraging such models, businesses can enhance their delivery strategies, ensuring they meet customer needs efficiently.

In summary, the selection of delivery options is a vital aspect of logistics strategy that directly impacts customer satisfaction and operational costs.

```python
from ortools.constraint_solver import pywrapcp
from ortools.constraint_solver import routing_enums_pb2

def create_data_model():
    data = {}
    data['distance_matrix'] = [
        [0, 2, 9, 10],
        [1, 0, 6, 4],
        [15, 7, 0, 8],
        [6, 3, 12, 0],
    ]  # A sample distance matrix
    data['num_vehicles'] = 1
    data['depot'] = 0
    return data

def main():
    data = create_data_model()
    manager = pywrapcp.RoutingIndexManager(len(data['distance_matrix']),
                                           data['num_vehicles'], data['depot'])
    routing = pywrapcp.RoutingModel(manager)

    def distance_callback(from_index, to_index):
        from_node = manager.IndexToNode(from_index)
        to_node = manager.IndexToNode(to_index)
        return data['distance_matrix'][from_node][to_node]

    transit_callback_index = routing.RegisterTransitCallback(distance_callback)
    routing.SetArcCostEvaluatorOfAllVehicles(transit_callback_index)

    search_parameters = pywrapcp.DefaultRoutingSearchParameters()
    search_parameters.first_solution_strategy = (
        routing_enums_pb2.FirstSolutionStrategy.PATH_CHEAPEST_ARC)

    solution = routing.SolveWithParameters(search_parameters)
    if solution:
        index = routing.Start(0)
        route_distance = 0
        while not routing.IsEnd(index):
            print(manager.IndexToNode(index), end=' -> ')
            previous_index = index
            index = solution.Value(routing.NextVar(index))
            route_distance += routing.GetArcCostForVehicle(previous_index, index, 0)
        print(manager.IndexToNode(index))
        print('Distance of the route: {}m'.format(route_distance))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

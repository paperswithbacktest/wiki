## What is Mathematical Finance?

Mathematical finance is a field where math and finance come together to help solve financial problems. It uses math tools like calculus, probability, and statistics to understand and manage financial markets, investments, and risks. People in this field create models to predict how prices might change or how much risk there is in an investment.

One important part of mathematical finance is figuring out how to price things like stocks, bonds, and options. By using math, experts can come up with formulas to decide if an investment is a good deal or not. This helps investors make smarter choices about where to put their money. Another big area is risk management, where math helps to measure and control the risks that come with investing. This way, people can protect their money better and make plans for the future.

## What are the basic prerequisites for pursuing a PhD in Mathematical Finance?

To pursue a PhD in Mathematical Finance, you typically need a strong background in mathematics and finance.

## How do the account minimums compare between TradeStation and Interactive Brokers?

TradeStation has different account minimums depending on the type of account you want to open. For a standard brokerage account, there is no minimum deposit required.

This makes TradeStation a good choice for people who are just starting out and don't have a lot of money to invest right away.

Interactive Brokers also has varying account minimums based on the type of account. For a standard individual account, the minimum is $0, which means you can start trading with any amount of money.

## What is the Absolute Priority Rule in bankruptcy?

The Absolute Priority Rule is a key principle in bankruptcy law, especially in Chapter 11 reorganizations. It states that when a company is going bankrupt, certain groups of people must be paid back in a specific order before others. This rule makes sure that everyone gets treated fairly, especially those who are owed money, like creditors.

In simple terms, the rule says that before shareholders can get any money or keep any part of the business, all other debts must be paid off first. This means that secured creditors, who have loans backed by assets, get paid first. Then, unsecured creditors, who don't have any collateral, get paid. Only after all these groups are paid can shareholders receive anything. This rule helps keep the bankruptcy process orderly and fair.

## How does the Absolute Priority Rule affect the order of payments in bankruptcy?

The Absolute Priority Rule sets the order of who gets paid first when a company goes bankrupt. It says that people who loaned money to the company and have something valuable as a guarantee, like a building or equipment, get paid before everyone else. These are called secured creditors. After they get their money, the next in line are the unsecured creditors, who loaned money without any guarantees. They get paid from whatever money is left.

Only after all the creditors are paid do the shareholders get anything. Shareholders are the people who own parts of the company. If there's no money left after paying the creditors, the shareholders get nothing. This rule makes sure that everyone is treated fairly and that people who took bigger risks, like unsecured creditors, don't get paid before those who were more secure, like secured creditors.

## In which types of bankruptcy proceedings does the Absolute Priority Rule apply?

The Absolute Priority Rule mainly applies in Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases. Chapter 11 is a type of bankruptcy where a business tries to reorganize and keep running instead of shutting down. In these cases, the rule makes sure that creditors get paid back in a certain order before shareholders can get any money or keep any part of the business.

The rule also comes up in Chapter 7 liquidations, but it's less common. In Chapter 7, a business is completely shut down and all its assets are sold off to pay back creditors. If there's any money left after paying secured and unsecured creditors, it goes to shareholders, but only if the Absolute Priority Rule is followed.

## Can you explain the historical development of the Absolute Priority Rule?

The Absolute Priority Rule has been around for a long time, but it really became important in the early 1900s. It started with a case called Northern Pacific Railway v. Boyd in 1913. In this case, the U.S. Supreme Court said that when a company goes bankrupt, the people who are owed money should get paid back before the people who own the company. This was the beginning of the rule, and it made sure that everyone was treated fairly during bankruptcy.

Over time, the rule became a big part of bankruptcy law, especially in Chapter 11 cases. In 1939, the Chandler Act made the rule even stronger by adding it to the Bankruptcy Code. This meant that the rule was now a clear part of the law, and it helped make the bankruptcy process more organized. The rule has been important ever since, making sure that creditors get paid back in the right order before shareholders get anything.

## What are the key cases that have shaped the interpretation of the Absolute Priority Rule?

The key case that started the Absolute Priority Rule was Northern Pacific Railway v. Boyd in 1913. In this case, the U.S. Supreme Court said that when a company goes bankrupt, the people who loaned money to the company should get paid back before the people who own the company. This was a big deal because it set a rule that made sure everyone was treated fairly during bankruptcy. It meant that the people who took the biggest risks, like unsecured creditors, wouldn't get paid before the people who had more security, like secured creditors.

Another important case was Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co. in 1939. This case made the rule even clearer and stronger. The Supreme Court said that the Absolute Priority Rule should be a big part of bankruptcy law. This case helped make the rule a clear part of the law, and it helped make the bankruptcy process more organized and fair. Since then, the rule has been a key part of bankruptcy cases, making sure that creditors get paid back in the right order before shareholders get anything.

## How does the Absolute Priority Rule impact secured and unsecured creditors?

The Absolute Priority Rule affects secured and unsecured creditors in a clear way. Secured creditors are the first to get paid when a company goes bankrupt. They have loans backed by something valuable, like a building or equipment. This means that if the company can't pay back the loan, the secured creditors can take the valuable thing to get their money back. Because of the Absolute Priority Rule, these creditors get their money before anyone else, which makes their loans safer.

Unsecured creditors, on the other hand, don't have anything valuable backing their loans. They took a bigger risk when they loaned money to the company. Because of this, the Absolute Priority Rule says they get paid after the secured creditors. They only get money if there's anything left after the secured creditors are paid. This rule makes sure that unsecured creditors don't jump ahead of secured creditors, which keeps the bankruptcy process fair.

## What exceptions exist to the Absolute Priority Rule, and under what conditions can they be applied?

There are a few exceptions to the Absolute Priority Rule. One big exception is called the "new value exception." This happens when shareholders, who own the company, put in new money or something valuable to help the company reorganize. If they do this, they might be able to keep some of their ownership in the company, even if the creditors haven't been paid back fully. But, this exception is tricky and not used very often. The new money or value has to be a lot, and it has to be something the creditors couldn't get on their own.

Another exception is when all the creditors agree to a different plan. If every creditor says it's okay, then the Absolute Priority Rule can be ignored. This is called a "consensual plan." It means that even if the rule says creditors should be paid back in a certain order, if they all agree to something else, it can happen. This exception is important because it lets companies and their creditors work together to find a solution that works for everyone.

## How has the Absolute Priority Rule been modified by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA)?

The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA), passed in 2005, made some changes to the Absolute Priority Rule. One big change was about small businesses. BAPCPA made it easier for small businesses to reorganize under Chapter 11 by adding a new rule. This rule says that if a small business's plan to reorganize is fair and doesn't harm creditors, it can be approved even if it doesn't follow the Absolute Priority Rule exactly. This helps small businesses keep going without having to pay back every creditor in the strict order the rule usually says.

Another change BAPCPA made was about individual debtors in Chapter 11 cases. Before BAPCPA, individuals had to follow the Absolute Priority Rule just like businesses. But after BAPCPA, individuals can keep some of their property even if they haven't paid back all their creditors, as long as they use their future income to pay off their debts. This makes it easier for people to keep their homes and cars while still trying to pay back what they owe. These changes show how the law tries to balance fairness with helping people and small businesses get back on their feet.

## Can shareholders receive any payment under the Absolute Priority Rule before all creditors are fully paid?

Under the Absolute Priority Rule, shareholders usually can't get any money or keep any part of the company until all the creditors are fully paid. This rule makes sure that people who loaned money to the company, like secured and unsecured creditors, get paid back in a certain order. Secured creditors, who have something valuable as a guarantee, get paid first. Then, unsecured creditors, who don't have any guarantees, get paid. Only after all these creditors are paid can shareholders get anything.

There are some special cases where shareholders might get something before all the creditors are paid. One is the "new value exception." This happens when shareholders put in new money or something valuable to help the company reorganize. If they do this, they might be able to keep some of their ownership, even if the creditors haven't been paid back fully. Another case is when all the creditors agree to a different plan. If every creditor says it's okay, then the Absolute Priority Rule can be ignored, and shareholders might get something before all the creditors are fully paid.

## What role does the Absolute Priority Rule play in Chapter 11 reorganizations?

The Absolute Priority Rule is a big deal in Chapter 11 reorganizations. It makes sure that when a company is trying to fix its money problems and keep running, everyone gets treated fairly. The rule says that people who loaned money to the company, like secured and unsecured creditors, have to get paid back in a certain order before the people who own the company, called shareholders, can get anything. This means that secured creditors, who have something valuable backing their loans, get paid first. Then, unsecured creditors, who don't have any guarantees, get paid. Only after all these creditors are paid can shareholders get any money or keep any part of the company.

There are a few special cases where shareholders might get something before all the creditors are fully paid. One is the "new value exception." This happens when shareholders put in new money or something valuable to help the company reorganize. If they do this, they might be able to keep some of their ownership, even if the creditors haven't been paid back fully. Another case is when all the creditors agree to a different plan. If every creditor says it's okay, then the Absolute Priority Rule can be ignored, and shareholders might get something before all the creditors are fully paid. These exceptions show that while the rule is strict, there can be some flexibility to help the company and its shareholders.

## How do courts interpret and apply the Absolute Priority Rule in complex bankruptcy cases?

In complex bankruptcy cases, courts have to carefully interpret and apply the Absolute Priority Rule to make sure everyone is treated fairly. The rule says that secured creditors, who have something valuable backing their loans, should get paid first. Then, unsecured creditors, who don't have any guarantees, get paid. Only after all these creditors are paid can shareholders get any money or keep any part of the company. Courts look at each case closely to see if the rule is being followed correctly. They check if the plan to reorganize the company is fair and if it follows the order of payments the rule sets out.

Sometimes, courts have to deal with special situations where the rule might not be followed exactly. One situation is the "new value exception," where shareholders put in new money or something valuable to help the company reorganize. If they do this, they might be able to keep some of their ownership, even if the creditors haven't been paid back fully. Another situation is when all the creditors agree to a different plan. If every creditor says it's okay, then the Absolute Priority Rule can be ignored, and shareholders might get something before all the creditors are fully paid. Courts have to balance these exceptions with the need to make sure the rule is followed to keep the bankruptcy process fair and organized.

## What are the current debates and potential reforms surrounding the Absolute Priority Rule?

There are ongoing debates about the Absolute Priority Rule and whether it should be changed. Some people think the rule is too strict and doesn't give companies enough flexibility to reorganize. They argue that allowing shareholders to keep some ownership, even if creditors aren't fully paid, can help the company recover faster. This could be good for the economy because it keeps businesses running and people employed. Others worry that changing the rule might make it less fair for creditors, who took the risk of lending money to the company.

Potential reforms to the Absolute Priority Rule focus on finding a balance between fairness and flexibility. One idea is to make it easier for companies to use the "new value exception," where shareholders can keep some ownership if they put in new money to help the company reorganize. Another idea is to allow more exceptions if creditors agree to different plans. These reforms could help more companies survive bankruptcy, but they also need to make sure that creditors are still treated fairly and get paid back as much as possible.

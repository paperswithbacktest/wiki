    data['Moving_Average'] = data['Price'].rolling(window=window).mean()
    # Buy signal: Price crosses above the moving average
    data['Signal'] = (data['Price'] > data['Moving_Average']).astype(int)
    return data

# Apply strategy
results = moving_average_strategy(data)

# Analyze results
profitable_trades = results[(results['Signal'] == 1) & (results['Price'].shift(-1) > results['Price'])]
print("Number of profitable trades:", len(profitable_trades))
```

At its core, [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) relies on mathematical models and quantitative analysis to identify trading opportunities. The process involves several key methodologies:

1. **Statistical Arbitrage**: Algorithms capitalize on statistical discrepancies between assets. By identifying mean-reverting price series, they execute trades to exploit these discrepancies until convergence occurs.

2. **Market Making**: Algorithms continuously place buy and sell orders to profit from the bid-ask spread, providing liquidity to financial markets.

3. **Trend Following**: Based on technical indicators like moving averages, these algorithms identify and follow market trends to gain profit from momentum-based trading.

4. **Mean Reversion**: This strategy assumes that prices eventually return to their historical averages. Algorithms recognize overbought or oversold conditions and trade accordingly.

Python has become an invaluable tool for developing algorithmic trading strategies. A basic example using a moving average crossover strategy is outlined below:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assume 'data' is a DataFrame containing historical price data with a 'Close' column
def moving_average_crossover(data, short_window=40, long_window=100):
    # Calculate short and long moving averages
    data['Short_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    data['Long_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

    # Generate signals
    data['Signal'] = 0
    data['Signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['Short_MA'][short_window:] > data['Long_MA'][short_window:], 1, -1)

    return data['Signal']

# Usage
# signals = moving_average_crossover(historic_data)
```

This example demonstrates how a moving average crossover strategy can be implemented in Python, where buy signals are generated when the short-term average surpasses the long-term average.

## The Origin of Baby Bells

The history of the Baby Bells is intrinsically tied to the story of AT&T, formally known as the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Established in 1885 by Alexander Graham Bell and Gardiner Greene Hubbard to provide long-distance telephone services, AT&T rapidly expanded to become the world's most formidable telecommunications monopoly. By the mid-20th century, AT&T, often called "Ma Bell," dominated the United States telecommunications landscape, controlling nearly all aspects of telephone services, including local and long-distance calls.

The seeds of dissolution were planted due to growing concerns over AT&T's monopolistic control. In 1974, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T, alleging it unlawfully maintained monopoly power in the telecommunications sector, especially in long-distance telephone services. After prolonged litigation, a groundbreaking settlement was reached in 1982, resulting in the divestiture of AT&Tâ€™s local exchange service operating companies. This agreement, known as the Modified Final Judgment, was carried out in 1984, culminating in the breakup of AT&T and the creation of seven independent Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), colloquially known as the "Baby Bells."

The seven Baby Bells formed were: 

1. Ameritech, serving five Great Lakes states.
2. Bell Atlantic, operating mainly in the Mid-Atlantic region.
3. BellSouth, in the southeastern United States.
4. NYNEX, covering New York and New England.
5. Pacific Telesis, in California and Nevada.
6. Southwestern Bell, operating in Texas and surrounding states.
7. US West, serving the northwestern United States.

The formation of the Baby Bells had a profound impact on the telecommunications market.

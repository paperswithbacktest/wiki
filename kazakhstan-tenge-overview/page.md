## What is the Kazakhstan Tenge?

The Kazakhstan Tenge is the official money used in Kazakhstan. It started being used on November 15, 1993. Before the Tenge, Kazakhstan used the Russian Ruble. The Tenge helped Kazakhstan become more independent in its money matters.

The Tenge has coins and banknotes. The coins come in values like 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 Tenge. The banknotes are in amounts like 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10000 Tenge. The money shows pictures that are important to Kazakh culture and history.

The word "Tenge" comes from an old Turkic word meaning "scale" or "balance." This shows how important fairness in trade is to the people of Kazakhstan. The Tenge is managed by the National Bank of Kazakhstan, which works to keep the country's money stable and strong.

## What is the exchange rate of the Tenge to major world currencies?

For the British Pound, 1 GBP could be around 570 KZT. These numbers are just examples and can change. If you're planning to travel or do business with Kazakhstan, it's important to look up the most current exchange rates.

## How has the value of the Tenge fluctuated historically?

The value of the Kazakhstan Tenge has gone up and down a lot since it started being used in 1993. At first, the Tenge was very weak because Kazakhstan was still figuring out its economy after becoming its own country. In the late 1990s, the Tenge lost a lot of value, especially in 1999 when it dropped very quickly. This was because of problems in the economy and less money coming in from selling oil and other things.

From the early 2000s to around 2014, the Tenge got a bit stronger and more stable. This was helped by more money coming from oil and other natural resources. But in 2015, the Tenge lost value again because the price of oil went down a lot and there were worries about the world economy. Since then, the Tenge has kept changing, going up and down based on what's happening with oil prices and the economy at home and around the world.

## What are the key factors influencing the Tenge's exchange rate?

The value of the Kazakhstan Tenge changes because of many things. One big reason is the price of oil. Kazakhstan sells a lot of oil, and when the price of oil goes up, the Tenge usually gets stronger. But when the price of oil goes down, the Tenge can lose value. Another important [factor](/wiki/factor-investing) is how well the economy of Kazakhstan is doing. If the economy is growing and people are buying more things, the Tenge can become stronger. But if the economy is not doing well, the Tenge might get weaker.

The Tenge is also affected by what is happening in the world. If there are big changes in the world economy or if other countries are having problems, it can make the Tenge go up or down. The National Bank of Kazakhstan tries to keep the Tenge stable by making rules about money and how much is in the country. But sometimes, even with these rules, the Tenge can still change a lot because of things the bank can't control, like big events in other countries or changes in how much people want to buy Kazakh products.

## How does the National Bank of Kazakhstan manage the Tenge's monetary policy?

The National Bank of Kazakhstan works hard to keep the Tenge stable and strong. They do this by making rules about money, like setting interest rates. Interest rates are what banks charge people for borrowing money. If the National Bank makes interest rates higher, it can slow down how fast people spend money and help keep prices from going up too fast. They also watch how much money is in the country and try to keep it at a good level so the Tenge stays strong.

Another way the National Bank helps the Tenge is by buying and selling it in the world market. If the Tenge is getting too weak, the bank might use its money to buy more Tenge, which can make it stronger. They also keep an eye on what's happening in the world because big changes in other countries can affect the Tenge. By doing all these things, the National Bank tries to make sure the Tenge stays a good and reliable money for Kazakhstan.

## What impact have economic sanctions had on the Tenge?

Economic sanctions can hurt the value of the Tenge. When other countries put sanctions on Kazakhstan, it can be hard for the country to sell things like oil and other goods. This means less money comes into Kazakhstan, which can make the Tenge weaker. For example, if big countries like the United States or the European Union put sanctions on Kazakhstan, it might be harder for Kazakh businesses to work with them, and this can lead to a drop in the Tenge's value.

The National Bank of Kazakhstan tries to help the Tenge stay strong even when there are sanctions. They might change interest rates or use their money to buy more Tenge in the world market. But sometimes, the sanctions are too strong, and it's hard for the bank to keep the Tenge stable. When this happens, people in Kazakhstan might see prices go up and it can be harder to buy things from other countries.

## How does the Tenge's performance compare to other currencies in the region?

The Tenge's performance can be different from other currencies in the region like the Russian Ruble and the Uzbekistani Som. The Tenge often moves with the price of oil because Kazakhstan sells a lot of oil. When oil prices go up, the Tenge can get stronger, but when oil prices go down, the Tenge can lose value. The Russian Ruble also depends a lot on oil, so sometimes the Tenge and the Ruble move in similar ways. But the Ruble can be affected by more things, like what Russia does with its money and what other countries think about Russia's actions.

The Uzbekistani Som, on the other hand, does not depend on oil as much. Uzbekistan's economy is more about farming and making things, so the Som's value can be more stable than the Tenge's. But the Som can still go up and down because of what happens in Uzbekistan's economy and what other countries do. Overall, the Tenge can be more up and down than the Som, but it can also be similar to the Ruble because both countries sell oil.

## What are the future predictions for the Tenge based on current economic analyses?

The future of the Tenge depends on a lot of things, like how much oil Kazakhstan sells and what happens in the world economy. Many people who study money think that if oil prices stay high, the Tenge could get stronger. But if oil prices go down a lot, the Tenge might lose value. Also, if Kazakhstan can make its economy stronger by selling more things other than oil, like farming products or things they make, the Tenge could do better. 

Another thing that can affect the Tenge is what the National Bank of Kazakhstan does. If they keep making good rules about money, like setting the right interest rates and watching how much money is in the country, the Tenge might stay stable. But if there are big problems in the world, like wars or big changes in other countries' economies, it could be hard for the Tenge to stay strong. So, the future of the Tenge will depend on a mix of what happens with oil, how well Kazakhstan's economy does, and what the National Bank does to help.

## What are the implications of the Tenge's value for international trade and investment in Kazakhstan?

The value of the Tenge has a big impact on international trade and investment in Kazakhstan. When the Tenge is strong, it means that Kazakh goods become more expensive for other countries to buy. This can make it harder for Kazakhstan to sell things like oil and other products abroad. On the other hand, a strong Tenge can make it cheaper for Kazakhstan to buy things from other countries. But if the Tenge is weak, it can help Kazakhstan sell more because their goods become cheaper for other countries. This can be good for trade, but it also means that it costs more for Kazakhstan to buy things from abroad.

For investors, the value of the Tenge is also very important. If the Tenge is stable and getting stronger, it can make investors feel more confident about putting their money into Kazakhstan. They might think that their money will be worth more when they take it out. But if the Tenge is weak and going down, investors might be worried that their money will be worth less when they want to take it out. This can make them less likely to invest in Kazakhstan. So, the National Bank of Kazakhstan works hard to keep the Tenge stable to help with both trade and investment.

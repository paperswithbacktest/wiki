This could lead to the custodian ending their relationship with the adviser, which means the adviser would lose the chance to manage that money.

Also, not filing Form ADV-E on time could lead to problems with the law. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is like a big boss that makes sure everyone follows the rules, might start looking into why the form was not filed on time. If they find out that the adviser did something wrong, the adviser could get fined or even lose their license to work as an investment adviser.

## Can Form ADV-E be amended, and if so, how?

Yes, Form ADV-E can be amended if something changes or if there is a mistake that needs to be fixed. If an investment adviser needs to make changes to the form, they have to fill out a new Form ADV-E with the updated information. This new form should be sent to the custodian, which is the company that holds onto the clients' money.

The adviser should explain why they are amending the form in a clear way. They can write a short note or letter to go along with the new form, saying what has changed and why. It's important to do this quickly so that the custodian always has the right information and can make sure the adviser is following the rules.

## What are the differences between Form ADV and Form ADV-E?

Form ADV and Form ADV-E are two different forms that investment advisers use, but they serve different purposes. Form ADV is a main form that all investment advisers have to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or state securities authorities. It gives a lot of information about the adviser's business, like who they are, what services they offer, how they get paid, and if they have any legal problems. It's like a big report that helps regulators keep an eye on advisers and make sure they are following the rules.

On the other hand, Form ADV-E is a special form that only some advisers need to fill out. It's used when an adviser works with a company called a custodian, which holds onto money and other assets for people. Form ADV-E helps the custodian check if the adviser is doing a good job and following the rules about managing the money. It's filed every year and includes details about how much money the adviser is managing, what kinds of investments they are making, and if there have been any problems. While Form ADV is about giving a broad picture of the adviser's business, Form ADV-E is more focused on ensuring the safety and honesty of the money they manage.

## How does the SEC use the information from Form ADV-E?

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses the information from Form ADV-E to make sure that investment advisers are following the rules when they work with custodians. A custodian is a company that holds onto money and other assets for people. The SEC looks at the form to see how much money the adviser is managing, what kinds of investments they are making, and if there have been any problems. This helps the SEC check if the adviser is keeping the clients' money safe and not doing anything wrong.

By reviewing Form ADV-E, the SEC can spot any issues or red flags that might need more looking into. If they find something that doesn't seem right, they might start an investigation to make sure the adviser is following the law. This helps keep the investment world honest and protects people's money.

## What are best practices for ensuring compliance with Form ADV-E requirements?

To make sure you follow the rules for Form ADV-E, it's important to keep good records. Write down everything about the money you manage, the investments you make, and any problems that come up. This way, when it's time to fill out the form, you have all the information you need. Also, set reminders for the deadline, which is 120 days after the end of your fiscal year. This helps you file the form on time and avoid any trouble.

It's also a good idea to double-check your work. Before you send Form ADV-E to the custodian, read it over carefully to make sure everything is correct. If you find any mistakes, fix them right away. If something changes after you file the form, fill out a new one with the updated information and send it to the custodian quickly. This shows that you are honest and careful, which helps build trust with the custodian and keeps you in line with the rules.

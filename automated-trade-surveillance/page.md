Similarly, supervised learning models can be trained on historical data to predict potential violations. Python, with its robust libraries such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, serves as a powerful tool for developing these machine learning models:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import numpy as np

# Sample data
trade_data = np.array([[10, 20], [15, 25], [5, 30], [1000, 2000], [12, 22]])

# Initialize Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
model.fit(trade_data)

# Predict anomalies
anomalies = model.predict(trade_data)

print(anomalies)
```

In this context, models such as the Isolation Forest can be utilized to detect outliers in transaction data that may indicate market manipulation. The rapid processing and predictive accuracy offered by such AI-driven approaches present a powerful advancement in trade surveillance, enhancing both efficiency and reliability in oversight functions.

## What are the potential risks associated with the concentration of ownership in JetBlue Airways?

When a few big investors like BlackRock and Vanguard own a lot of JetBlue Airways' shares, it can be risky. If these big investors decide to sell their shares all at once, it could make the stock price drop a lot. This is because there would be more shares for sale than people wanting to buy them. Also, if these big investors have too much control, they might make decisions that are good for them but not so good for smaller shareholders or the company's long-term health. For example, they might push for quick profits instead of investing in things that could help JetBlue grow over time.

Another risk is that the company might not listen to what smaller shareholders want. When big investors have most of the votes, the voices of regular people who own shares might not be heard. This can make people feel like they don't matter, which could lead to less support for the company. Plus, if insiders like the CEO own very few shares, they might not feel as connected to the company's success. This could make them less motivated to make the best decisions for JetBlue. Overall, having a lot of shares owned by just a few big investors can create problems for JetBlue and its other shareholders.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is a U.S. government agency that oversees the trading of futures and options on commodities. Commodities are things like oil, gold, and wheat that people buy and sell. The CFTC makes sure that these markets are fair and that no one is cheating. It also helps protect people who invest in these markets by making sure they have the right information to make good choices.

The CFTC was created in 1974, after a big problem in the markets called the "soybean default." This showed that there needed to be a special agency to watch over these markets. The CFTC works to stop fraud, manipulation, and other bad practices. It also works with other agencies and countries to make sure that the rules for trading commodities are followed everywhere.

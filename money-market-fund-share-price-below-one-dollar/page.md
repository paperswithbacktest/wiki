## What is a money market fund?

A money market fund is a type of investment where people pool their money together to buy safe, short-term securities like government bonds or certificates of deposit. These funds aim to keep the value of each share at $1, which makes them a stable and low-risk option for investors. People often use money market funds to save money temporarily or as a place to keep money they might need soon.

Money market funds are different from putting money in a regular savings account at a bank. While savings accounts are insured by the government, money market funds are not. However, they usually offer higher interest rates than savings accounts, which can be attractive to people looking to earn a bit more on their cash. They are popular among investors who want to keep their money safe but still earn some return.

## Why is a money market fund share price important?

The share price of a money market fund is important because it shows how stable the fund is. Most money market funds try to keep their share price at $1. This is called maintaining a "stable net asset value." When the share price stays at $1, it means the fund is doing well at managing its investments and keeping things safe for investors. If the share price stays steady, people feel more confident that their money is safe.

However, if the share price drops below $1, it's called "breaking the buck." This is a big deal because it shows that the fund might be having problems. When this happens, investors can get worried and might want to take their money out of the fund. So, keeping the share price at $1 is a big goal for money market funds. It helps keep investors happy and trusting that their money is in a safe place.

## What does it mean when a money market fund's share price falls below one dollar?

When a money market fund's share price falls below one dollar, it's called "breaking the buck." This is a big problem because it means the fund's investments are not doing well. Money market funds try hard to keep their share price at one dollar because it shows they are safe and stable. If the price drops below a dollar, it can make investors worried and scared.

When investors see the share price fall below a dollar, they might want to take their money out of the fund quickly. This can cause more problems for the fund because it might need to sell its investments at bad prices to give money back to people. So, "breaking the buck" is something money market funds work hard to avoid because it can shake the trust of the people who put their money in the fund.

## What are the common causes of a money market fund's share price dropping below one dollar?

A money market fund's share price can drop below one dollar because of big losses in the fund's investments. These funds usually put money into safe things like government bonds or short-term loans to companies. But if something goes wrong, like a company not being able to pay back a loan or if the value of a bond drops a lot, the fund can lose money. If these losses are big enough, they can pull the share price down below a dollar.

Another reason this can happen is if a lot of people want to take their money out of the fund at the same time. This is called a "run on the fund." When this happens, the fund might have to sell its investments quickly to give money back to people. Selling investments in a hurry can mean getting less money for them than they're worth, which can also cause the share price to fall below a dollar. So, both big investment losses and a rush of people wanting their money back can lead to a money market fund "breaking the buck."

## How often does a money market fund's share price fall below one dollar?

It's pretty rare for a money market fund's share price to fall below one dollar. This is because these funds try really hard to keep their share price at one dollar. They do this by investing in safe things like government bonds and short-term loans to companies. Because they focus on safe investments, it doesn't happen often that they lose enough money to make the share price drop below a dollar.

However, it can happen if something goes really wrong. For example, if a company that borrowed money from the fund can't pay it back, or if the value of a bond drops a lot, the fund might lose money. If these losses are big enough, they can pull the share price down. Also, if a lot of people want to take their money out of the fund at the same time, the fund might have to sell its investments quickly, which can also make the share price fall below a dollar. So, while it's rare, it's important for money market funds to watch out for these risks.

## What are the potential risks to investors when a money market fund's share price drops below one dollar?

When a money market fund's share price drops below one dollar, it means the fund has lost money. This can be scary for investors because they might lose some of their money too. If the share price falls, the value of what they own in the fund goes down. This can make people worried about their savings, especially if they were counting on the money market fund to be a safe place to keep their money.

Another risk is that when the share price drops, a lot of people might want to take their money out of the fund at the same time. This is called a "run on the fund." When this happens, the fund might have to sell its investments quickly to give money back to people. Selling in a hurry can mean getting less money for the investments than they're worth, which can make the problem even worse. So, investors could end up with less money than they put in if the fund can't handle everyone wanting their money back at once.

## What measures can fund managers take to prevent a money market fund's share price from falling below one dollar?

Fund managers can take several steps to keep a money market fund's share price from falling below one dollar. One important thing they do is to be very careful about what they invest in. They choose safe investments like government bonds and short-term loans to companies that are less likely to lose value. By sticking to these safe choices, they try to avoid big losses that could pull the share price down. They also keep a close eye on the credit quality of the companies they lend to, making sure they can pay back the loans.

Another measure fund managers take is to keep some extra money in the fund, which is called a "[liquidity](/wiki/liquidity-risk-premium) buffer." This extra money can be used to buy back shares if a lot of people want to take their money out at the same time. Having this buffer helps prevent the need to sell investments quickly at bad prices. Fund managers might also use something called "amortized cost accounting," which helps keep the share price steady by spreading out the cost of investments over time. By using these strategies, fund managers work hard to keep the share price at one dollar and keep investors' money safe.

## How does the SEC regulate money market funds to protect investors from share price declines?

The SEC, or Securities and Exchange Commission, has rules to help keep money market funds safe for investors. One big rule is that money market funds have to keep their investments very safe. They can only put money into things like government bonds and short-term loans to companies that are not likely to lose value. The SEC also says that funds need to have a certain amount of their money in very safe and easy-to-sell investments, like cash or government securities. This helps the fund stay stable and ready to give money back to investors if they need it.

Another way the SEC protects investors is by making sure money market funds have enough money set aside, called a "liquidity buffer." This extra money can be used if a lot of people want to take their money out at the same time. The SEC also requires funds to tell investors if the share price is at risk of falling below one dollar. This way, investors can make smart choices about their money. By having these rules, the SEC helps make sure that money market funds stay safe and that investors don't lose their money.

## What historical events have led to money market funds breaking the buck?

One big time when a money market fund broke the buck was during the 2008 financial crisis. A fund called the Reserve Primary Fund had a lot of money in Lehman Brothers, a big bank that went bankrupt. When Lehman Brothers failed, the Reserve Primary Fund lost a lot of money. This made the fund's share price fall below one dollar. It was a scary time because it made people worry about their money in other money market funds too. A lot of people started taking their money out of these funds, which made things even worse.

Another time a money market fund broke the buck was in 1994 with a fund called Community Bankers U.S. Government Money Market Fund. This fund had put a lot of money into some special kinds of bonds that were not as safe as they thought. When the value of these bonds dropped a lot, the fund lost money and its share price fell below one dollar. This was a big surprise because people thought money market funds were always safe. It showed that even though money market funds try to be safe, sometimes things can go wrong.

## How do investors react when a money market fund's share price falls below one dollar?

When a money market fund's share price falls below one dollar, investors often get scared and worried. They might start pulling their money out of the fund quickly because they don't want to lose any more money. This rush to take money out can make things even worse for the fund, causing what's called a "run on the fund." When a lot of people want their money back at the same time, the fund might have to sell its investments in a hurry, which can lead to more losses and make the share price drop even more.

This kind of event can shake people's trust in money market funds. Investors might move their money to other places they think are safer, like bank savings accounts or other types of investments. It can also make them more careful about where they put their money in the future. They might look for funds that have a strong track record of keeping their share price stable or choose funds that invest in even safer assets.

## What are the long-term implications for a money market fund that has experienced a share price drop below one dollar?

When a money market fund's share price falls below one dollar, it can have big effects on the fund for a long time. People start to trust the fund less because they see it as risky. This can make it hard for the fund to get new investors. People who already have money in the fund might take their money out and put it somewhere safer. This loss of trust can hurt the fund's business a lot, making it harder for them to grow and do well in the future.

Also, the fund might have to change the way it works to try to win back people's trust. They might need to be more careful about what they invest in, choosing even safer options. They might also need to keep more money set aside as a safety net. All these changes can make it harder for the fund to make money. If the fund can't fix its problems and regain trust, it might even have to close down. So, a share price drop below one dollar can cause big problems for a money market fund in the long run.

## How can investors protect themselves from the risks associated with money market funds breaking the buck?

Investors can protect themselves from the risks of money market funds breaking the buck by being careful about which funds they choose. They should look for funds that invest in very safe things like government bonds and have a good track record of keeping their share price at one dollar. It's also a good idea to check if the fund has a strong "liquidity buffer," which is extra money they can use if a lot of people want to take their money out at the same time. By [picking](/wiki/asset-class-picking) funds that are managed carefully and have a history of being stable, investors can lower the chance of losing money.

Another way investors can protect themselves is by not putting all their money into just one money market fund. Spreading their money across different types of investments, like savings accounts, other types of funds, or even different money market funds, can help. This way, if one fund has problems, they won't lose all their money. It's also important to keep an eye on the news and any updates from the fund, so they can take their money out quickly if they see signs that the fund might be in trouble. By being smart and careful, investors can keep their money safer.

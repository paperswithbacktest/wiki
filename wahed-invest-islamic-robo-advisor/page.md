When you look at the past, Wahed Invest has had different returns depending on the time you look at.

## What are the risks involved in investing with Wahed Invest?

Investing with Wahed Invest, like any investing, comes with risks. The value of your investments can go up and down because of things happening in the stock market or the economy.

Wahed Invest tries to pick good investments that follow Islamic rules, but they can't control everything that happens in the market.

Another risk is that Wahed Invest's focus on Shariah compliance might mean they miss out on some investments that could grow faster but don't follow Islamic rules. This means their returns might be different from other investment companies that don't have these rules. It's important to remember that all investing has risks, and Wahed Invest does its best to manage these risks while staying true to Islamic principles.

## How does Wahed Invest's robo-advisor technology compare to traditional financial advisors?

Wahed Invest's robo-advisor technology is different from traditional financial advisors because it uses computers to pick and manage investments. With Wahed Invest, you answer some questions about how much risk you're okay with and how long you want to invest. Then, their computer system creates a plan for you that follows Islamic rules. This makes it easy and fast, and you don't have to pay as much as you would for a human advisor. Traditional financial advisors, on the other hand, are people who sit down with you, talk about your goals, and give you personal advice. They might know you better and can change your investments more often based on what's happening in your life or the market.

Even though robo-advisors like Wahed Invest are cheaper and easy to use, they might not give you the personal touch that a human advisor can. A traditional advisor can explain things in a way that's easy to understand and help you feel more comfortable with your choices. They can also meet with you regularly to make sure your investments are still a good fit for you. But with Wahed Invest, you get the benefit of knowing your money is being handled in a way that follows your Islamic beliefs, and you can check on your investments anytime using their website or app. So, it really depends on what you're looking for - the personal service of a human advisor or the easy, low-cost way of a robo-advisor that stays true to your faith.

## What future developments or expansions are planned for Wahed Invest?

Wahed Invest is always looking to grow and help more people invest in a way that follows Islamic rules. They want to offer their services in more countries around the world. Right now, they are working on getting the right permissions to start in new places. This means more Muslims can use Wahed Invest to grow their money while staying true to their faith.

They are also thinking about adding new types of investments to their platform. This could include things like real estate or other ways to invest that still follow Shariah law. By doing this, Wahed Invest hopes to give people more choices and help them reach their money goals in different ways. They want to keep making their service better and easier to use, so more people can feel good about where their money is going.

## What is a Robo-Advisor?

Robo-advisors are technological platforms that utilize advanced algorithms to deliver financial advice and manage investment portfolios with minimal human intervention. These platforms have rapidly gained popularity due to their ability to provide cost-effective, automated investing solutions typically accessible through user-friendly mobile applications. The increasing demand for robo-advisors can be attributed to their efficiency in managing portfolios, significantly reducing the overhead that is typically associated with traditional financial advisory services.

One of the fundamental principles employed by robo-advisors is modern portfolio theory (MPT), which aims to optimize diversification and manage risk. MPT suggests that it is possible to construct an 'efficient frontier' of optimal portfolios offering the maximum possible expected return for a given level of risk. This is mathematically represented by the equation:

$$
E(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i E(R_i)
$$

where $E(R_p)$ is the expected return of the portfolio, $w_i$ are the weights of each individual asset, and $E(R_i)$ is the expected return of asset $i$.

By leveraging such theories, robo-advisors are capable of providing bespoke investment solutions tailored to an individual's specific risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizons. This customization ensures that each user receives a personalized and strategically optimized portfolio.

Wahed Invest differentiates itself from conventional robo-advisors by embedding Islamic Sharia-compliant principles within its investment strategy. This integration ensures that all financial activities adhere to the ethical guidelines dictated by Islamic finance, which prohibits investments in certain sectors such as alcohol, gambling, and interest-based financial services. By doing so, Wahed Invest caters to the unique needs of Muslim investors, as well as those who are interested in ethical and socially responsible investing practices, setting it apart in the robo-advisory landscape.

## What are the mechanics of Wahed Invest's algorithmic trading model?

Wahed Invest employs a sophisticated [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) model designed to automatically rebalance investor portfolios at regular intervals. This process is pivotal for maintaining an optimal balance of assets that align with the investor's predefined risk tolerance. The algorithm evaluates current market conditions and makes adjustments to the portfolio to reflect an ideal asset distribution.

The core of Wahed Invest's strategy involves leveraging technology to manage risk dynamically. Algorithms continually assess the market and, when necessary, execute trades to keep portfolios within set risk parameters. This approach allows for rapid responses to market [volatility](/wiki/volatility-trading-strategies), thereby protecting investors from excessive exposure to riskier assets. By doing so, the platform aims to optimize performance and ensure that portfolios remain diversified according to each investor's specific goals.

Algorithmic rebalancing at Wahed Invest involves mathematical models that can be expressed using formulas such as:

$$
\text{New Portfolio Weight} = \frac{\text{Current Asset Value}}{\text{Total Portfolio Value}}
$$

This formula ensures that each asset in the portfolio is held in proportion to its market value, enabling proportional adjustments based on market shifts.

Despite the automation benefits, Wahed Invest's rebalancing practices came under scrutiny by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2022. The SEC's concerns were likely tied to transparency and adherence to stated investment strategies. However, Wahed is committed to improving its systems through ongoing technological advances and enhanced financial strategies.

The company remains dedicated to refining its platform to better serve its clients, balancing the efficiency of automated trading with the need for transparency and regulatory compliance. This commitment underscores Wahed Invest's focus on creating a robust, ethical investment experience while responding proactively to regulatory feedback and technological innovations.

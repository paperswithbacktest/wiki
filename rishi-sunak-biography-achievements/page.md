Rishi Sunak entered the political landscape with a strong background in finance, which played a pivotal role in his rapid ascension within the Conservative Party. He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Richmond in North Yorkshire in the 2015 general election, succeeding former Conservative Party leader William Hague.

In February 2020, Sunak was appointed as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a key position within the UK government, making him responsible for the economic and financial matters of the country. He succeeded Sajid Javid and was tasked with steering the UK economy, particularly during the uncertain period shaped by Brexit's aftermath and the nascent stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Sunak's tenure as Chancellor is marked by significant financial policies and reforms aimed at enhancing fiscal stability and economic resilience. Early in his role, he introduced a comprehensive budget that focused on investment in infrastructure and innovation, aiming to stimulate long-term economic growth. Among his notable financial policies was the "Eat Out to Help Out" scheme launched in August 2020, designed to support the hospitality sector, which suffered greatly due to the pandemic. The scheme provided discounts for dining out, incentivizing consumer spending and helping sustain numerous businesses.

Sunak was pivotal in launching extensive economic support packages during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.

Rishi Sunak, during his tenure in government, particularly as Chancellor of the Exchequer, has been credited with implementing a series of notable initiatives designed to support the UK economy and businesses. One of his most prominent initiatives was the ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ scheme, introduced in response to the economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This scheme aimed to revitalize the hospitality sector by offering government-funded discounts on meals to diners eating at cafes, pubs, and restaurants during August 2020. The initiative provided a 50% discount, up to £10 per person, on meals consumed on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Overall, the scheme succeeded in boosting footfall in restaurants and was utilized more than 100 million times, although its effectiveness faced scrutiny, as some studies suggested it may have aided temporarily in increasing foot traffic but potentially contributed to a rise in COVID-19 cases as well.

In addition to his immediate responses to the pandemic, Sunak made significant adjustments to tax policies and economic strategies aimed at long-term fiscal stability and growth. Key tax policy changes under his leadership included the reversal of planned corporate tax cuts, positioning this move as a method to achieve fiscal prudence and curb rising national debt levels. He proposed increasing the corporate tax rate from 19% to 25% by 2023, marking the first such increase in nearly five decades, as part of a broader economic strategy to balance public finances post-pandemic.

Sunak's approach to economic strategy also included significant fiscal support measures. During the pandemic, he rolled out substantial economic packages, including the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which subsidized wages for employees unable to work due to lockdowns, thus preserving jobs and stabilizing the economy.

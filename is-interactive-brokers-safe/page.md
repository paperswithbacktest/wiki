They also make sure that these accounts are at big, safe banks that are watched over by government agencies.

Another way Interactive Brokers protects client funds is by using something called the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). This organization helps protect clients if a brokerage firm goes bankrupt. SIPC can cover up to $500,000, including a $250,000 limit for cash. On top of this, Interactive Brokers has extra insurance from a company called Lloyd's of London, which can cover even more money if needed. This means your investments are extra safe with them.

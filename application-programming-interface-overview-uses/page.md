# Define your API key and endpoint
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
base_url = 'https://api.example.com'

# Function to authenticate and request data
def get_market_data(symbol):
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
    endpoint = f'{base_url}/market-data/{symbol}'
    response = requests.get(endpoint, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Example usage
symbol = 'BTCUSD'
market_data = get_market_data(symbol)
print(market_data)

# Function to place a trade
def place_trade(symbol, quantity, side):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    data = {
        'symbol': symbol,
        'qty': quantity,
        'side': side  # 'buy' or 'sell'
    }
    endpoint = f'{base_url}/orders'
    response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.json()

# Example trade execution
trade_response = place_trade('BTCUSD', 0.1, 'buy')
print(trade_response)
```

In this code snippet, the `get_market_data` function requests real-time market data for a specified symbol, while the `place_trade` function executes a trade by specifying the symbol, quantity, and side (buy or sell). 

Integrating APIs is not simply about connecting to them.

print(sys.path)
```

If discrepancies are found, updating configuration files to reflect the correct paths can resolve the problem. Another effective strategy is to isolate these dependencies within virtual environments using tools like `virtualenv` or `Anaconda`. Virtual environments create isolated spaces where dependencies for specific projects do not interfere with each other. To create and activate a virtual environment, use:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Unix or macOS
myenv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

Such environments ensure that the system’s global Python dependencies remain unaffected, preventing version conflicts. If persistent issues occur, consulting online communities, package documentation, or forums dedicated to Python and algorithmic trading can provide further assistance and updates on recent compatibility solutions.

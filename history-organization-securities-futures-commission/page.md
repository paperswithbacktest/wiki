## What significant reforms or changes has the SFC implemented over the years?

Over the years, the SFC has made many big changes to keep the market safe and fair. One big change was the introduction of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) in 2003. This new law brought together all the old rules into one big rulebook. It made things clearer and easier for everyone to follow.

## How does the SFC handle enforcement and what are some notable cases it has dealt with?

The SFC handles enforcement by watching the market closely and taking action when someone breaks the rules. They can give out fines, stop people from working in the market, or even take them to court. The SFC has a team that looks for signs of wrongdoing, like insider trading or fraud. If they find something, they start an investigation. They gather evidence and talk to people involved. If they find enough proof, they take action to make sure the market stays fair and safe for everyone.

This helped protect investors and made the market safer.

## What are the current challenges and future directions for the SFC?

The SFC faces many challenges today. One big challenge is keeping up with new technology like cryptocurrencies and online trading. These new things can be hard to watch over and can bring new risks to the market. The SFC needs to make new rules to keep these new investments safe for people to use. Another challenge is working with other countries. The market is now global, and what happens in one country can affect others. The SFC needs to work with other regulators around the world to share information and make rules that everyone can follow. This can be hard because different countries have different rules and ways of doing things.

Looking to the future, the SFC wants to keep making the market better and safer. They plan to use new technology to make trading easier and more open. They also want to teach more people about investing so that everyone can make smart choices with their money.

## What is an activist shareholder?

An activist shareholder is someone who buys a lot of shares in a company and then tries to change how the company is run. They think the company can do better, so they use their shares to push for changes. These changes might be about who runs the company, how it spends its money, or what it focuses on.

Activist shareholders often speak up at shareholder meetings or write letters to the company's leaders. They might want the company to be more environmentally friendly, treat workers better, or make more money for shareholders. Sometimes, their ideas help the company improve, but other times, the company's leaders might not agree with them.

## What are the primary goals of an activist shareholder?

The main goal of an activist shareholder is to make the company better. They believe that by getting involved, they can help the company make more money or run more efficiently. This might mean changing who is in charge, like the CEO or the board of directors, or it might mean changing how the company spends its money. For example, they might want the company to stop spending on projects that aren't making money and start focusing on ones that are.

Another goal can be to make the company more responsible. Activist shareholders might push for the company to be more environmentally friendly or to treat its workers better. They think that these changes can make the company more popular with customers and employees, which can lead to more success in the long run. By using their shares to influence the company, activist shareholders hope to guide it toward a better future.

## How does an activist shareholder typically acquire a stake in a company?

An activist shareholder usually starts by buying a lot of shares in a company they think can do better. They might buy these shares on the stock market, just like anyone else who wants to invest in a company. Sometimes, they buy enough shares to own a big part of the company, which gives them more power to make changes. They might also team up with other investors who agree with them to buy even more shares together.

Once they have enough shares, they can start to push for the changes they want. They might talk to the company's leaders directly or write letters to explain their ideas. They can also use their shares to vote at shareholder meetings, where they might try to get other shareholders to support their ideas too. By having a big stake in the company, they have a stronger voice and a better chance of making the changes they believe in.

## What are some common strategies used by activist shareholders to influence company management?

Activist shareholders often start by talking directly to the company's leaders. They might write letters or meet with them to explain their ideas and why they think the company should change. If the leaders agree, they might work together to make those changes happen. But if the leaders don't agree, the activist shareholders might need to use other ways to get their point across.

One common way is to use their shares to vote at shareholder meetings. At these meetings, shareholders can vote on important decisions, like who should be on the board of directors or how the company should spend its money. Activist shareholders can try to get other shareholders to vote with them, which can help them push through the changes they want. They might also suggest new people to join the board who agree with their ideas.

Sometimes, activist shareholders go public with their ideas. They might write reports or talk to the media to explain why they think the company should change. This can put pressure on the company's leaders because they might not want bad publicity. By using these strategies, activist shareholders try to make the company better, whether it's by making more money or being more responsible.

## Can you explain the concept of a proxy fight and its role in shareholder activism?

A proxy fight is when activist shareholders try to get other shareholders to vote for their ideas instead of the company's leaders. It's like a voting contest where the activist shareholders want to take control or make big changes in the company. They do this by sending out their own voting forms, called proxies, to other shareholders. These proxies ask the shareholders to vote for the activist shareholders' ideas at the next big meeting. If enough shareholders agree and send back the proxies, the activist shareholders can win the vote and make the changes they want.

Proxy fights are a big part of shareholder activism because they give activist shareholders a way to challenge the company's leaders. If the leaders aren't listening to their ideas, a proxy fight can be a way to force them to pay attention. It's a powerful tool because it lets activist shareholders gather support from other shareholders who might also want to see changes in the company. By winning a proxy fight, activist shareholders can get new people on the board of directors or push through new plans that they believe will make the company better.

## What is the difference between activist shareholders and institutional investors?

Activist shareholders and institutional investors both buy shares in companies, but they have different goals. Activist shareholders want to change how the company works. They believe the company can do better, so they use their shares to push for changes like new leaders, different ways to spend money, or better treatment of the environment and workers. They might start proxy fights to get other shareholders to vote for their ideas.

Institutional investors, on the other hand, are big organizations like banks, insurance companies, or pension funds that invest money on behalf of others. Their main goal is to make money for those they represent, not to change how the company runs. They usually hold onto their shares for a long time and might not get involved in the day-to-day decisions of the company. While they might vote at shareholder meetings, they usually don't try to take over the company or push for big changes like activist shareholders do.

## How do activist shareholders use media and public relations in their campaigns?

Activist shareholders often use the media and public relations to help get their message out. They might write reports or articles that explain why they think the company should change. By sharing these with newspapers, TV stations, and websites, they can reach a lot of people quickly. This can put pressure on the company's leaders because they might not want bad publicity. If the public starts to agree with the activist shareholders, it can make it harder for the company to ignore their ideas.

Sometimes, activist shareholders will hold press conferences or use social media to talk about their campaigns. They might post updates on Twitter or make videos for YouTube to keep people interested in what they're doing. By using these tools, they can build a community of supporters who might help them push for changes. This public support can be very powerful because it shows the company that people care about the issues the activist shareholders are raising.

## What legal and regulatory frameworks govern the activities of activist shareholders?

Activist shareholders have to follow certain rules and laws when they try to change how a company works. In the United States, the main law they need to know is the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This law has rules about what activist shareholders can do with their shares and how they can talk to other shareholders. For example, they have to tell the company if they own a lot of shares, and they have to be careful about what they say to other shareholders so they don't break any rules about sharing secret information.

There are also rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that activist shareholders need to follow. These rules say how they can run a proxy fight and what they have to tell other shareholders. The SEC wants to make sure that everyone has the same information and that the voting is fair. In other countries, there might be different laws and rules, but the main idea is the same: to make sure that activist shareholders play by the rules and don't do anything that could hurt the company or other shareholders.

## How do companies typically respond to activist shareholder campaigns?

When companies face campaigns from activist shareholders, they often start by talking to them. They might meet with the activists to listen to their ideas and see if they can work together. Sometimes, the company agrees that the activists have good points and decides to make some changes. For example, they might change how they spend money or add new people to the board of directors who agree with the activists' ideas.

If the company doesn't agree with the activists, they might try to fight back. They could use their own reports and media to explain why they think the activists are wrong. They might also talk to other shareholders to get them on their side. Sometimes, this leads to a proxy fight, where both sides try to get as many votes as they can at the next big meeting. The company will do its best to keep control and stop the activists from making the changes they want.

In some cases, the company might decide to make small changes to keep the activists happy without giving them too much power. They might change some of their policies or start new projects that the activists like. This can help calm things down and stop the campaign from getting too big. But if the activists keep pushing, the company might have to deal with a long and tough fight.

## What are the potential benefits and risks for a company targeted by an activist shareholder?

When a company is targeted by an activist shareholder, there can be some good things that come out of it. The activist might have ideas that can help the company make more money or run better. For example, they might suggest new ways to spend money that could lead to more profits. They might also push for the company to be more environmentally friendly or treat workers better, which can make the company more popular with customers and employees. If the company listens to these ideas and makes changes, it could end up doing much better in the long run.

But there are also risks that come with activist shareholders. If the company and the activists don't agree, it can lead to a lot of fighting. This fighting can be bad for the company because it might scare away customers or make it hard to focus on running the business. The company might also have to spend a lot of time and money dealing with the activists instead of working on other important things. If the activists win and make big changes, it might not always work out the way they planned, and the company could end up worse off than before.

## Can you discuss a notable case study where an activist shareholder significantly impacted a company's strategy?

One famous example of an activist shareholder changing a company's strategy is when Carl Icahn targeted Apple in 2013. Icahn believed that Apple was not using its money wisely and should be giving more back to shareholders. He bought a lot of Apple's shares and then started talking to the company's leaders. He wanted Apple to buy back more of its own shares, which would make the remaining shares worth more money. At first, Apple's leaders didn't agree with Icahn, but after he kept pushing, they decided to start a big buyback program. This made Apple's shareholders happy and showed that activist shareholders can have a big impact on what a company does with its money.

Another example is when Nelson Peltz and his company Trian Fund Management targeted Procter & Gamble (P&G) in 2017. Peltz thought P&G was not growing fast enough and needed to change how it was run. He wanted to join P&G's board of directors to help make these changes. P&G's leaders didn't want Peltz on the board, so they fought back hard. This led to a big proxy fight where both sides tried to get as many votes as they could. In the end, Peltz won a seat on the board. While he didn't get all the changes he wanted, P&G did start to focus more on growing its business and cutting costs, which helped the company do better.

## How might future trends in corporate governance affect the role of activist shareholders?

Future trends in how companies are run might make activist shareholders even more important. As more people care about things like the environment and how workers are treated, activist shareholders could have a bigger say in pushing companies to be more responsible. Also, with new technology, it's easier for activist shareholders to talk to other shareholders and get their support. This means they might be able to start more campaigns and have a bigger impact on what companies do. If companies start to see that listening to activist shareholders can help them do better, they might be more open to working with them.

On the other hand, some companies might try to make it harder for activist shareholders to cause trouble. They might change their rules to make it tougher for activists to start proxy fights or get on the board of directors. Governments might also make new laws to keep activist shareholders in check and stop them from doing things that could hurt the company or other shareholders. But even with these challenges, activist shareholders will likely keep playing a big role in making companies better, as long as they can find ways to work within the rules and keep pushing for the changes they believe in.

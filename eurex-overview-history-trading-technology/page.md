## A Brief History of Eurex

Eurex, a vital part of the global derivatives market, was born out of a cooperative initiative between Deutsche Börse AG and the SIX Swiss Exchange in 1998. This establishment came during a period predominantly characterized by traditional open outcry systems in trading pits, where traders would shout orders on the trading floor. Recognizing the potential for technological advancement, Eurex pursued a fully electronic trading model from its inception, making a significant departure from the established norm.

The introduction of an electronic trading platform marked Eurex as a pioneer, setting a benchmark for modern exchanges globally. This innovation not only facilitated real-time trading across various geographies but also enhanced transparency, reduced operational costs, and minimized the possibility of human errors associated with manual trading. The platform gave rise to increased participation from international traders who could now engage with the market from remote locations, thus broadening Eurex's reach substantially.

Eurex's evolution continued over the years with strategic developments and expansions. A notable milestone in its history occurred in 2012 when Deutsche Börse AG acquired full ownership of Eurex. This acquisition was a catalyst for further growth and innovation within the exchange. Under complete ownership, Deutsche Börse AG could streamline operations and direct resources more effectively towards advancing Eurex's technological and market offerings.

Under its full ownership, Eurex undertook several key initiatives to expand its product range and enhance trading systems, thereby solidifying its position in the global market. These efforts included the introduction of new futures and options products tailored to meet the diverse needs of global investors and the continual refinement of its electronic trading infrastructure.

Throughout its history, Eurex has been responsive to regulatory changes and market demands, continuously updating its policies and systems to ensure compliance and efficiency. The exchange has maintained a strong commitment to innovation, consistently exploring new technology applications to meet the evolving expectations of market participants. Its proactive stance in adopting and advancing electronic trading has positioned Eurex as a leader in the derivatives market.

Eurex’s journey from a joint venture to a wholly owned subsidiary is a testament to its strategic foresight and adaptability in an ever-changing market landscape. By capitalizing on technological advancements and driving market integration, Eurex has established itself as a key player in the international financial markets, influencing trading practices and setting standards for exchanges worldwide.

At its core, algorithmic trading employs complex mathematical models and rapid executions to optimize trading outcomes by identifying profitable opportunities faster than human traders. Eurex has integrated algorithmic strategies to enhance market access, liquidity provision, and price discovery.

Eurex's application of algorithmic trading strategies often revolves around optimizing execution strategies like [market making](/wiki/market-making), [arbitrage](/wiki/arbitrage), and [statistical arbitrage](/wiki/statistical-arbitrage).

Amidst the complexities of trading, Eurex provides a suite of tools designed to support algo traders. These tools, part of the Eurex Trading Interfaces, include the Enhanced Trading Interface (ETI) and the Eurex Trader GUI. ETI enables high-frequency and algorithmic trading with low latency and high throughput, essential for executing complex strategies swiftly.

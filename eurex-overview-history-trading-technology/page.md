## What are some advanced trading strategies that can be implemented on Eurex?

One advanced trading strategy that can be used on Eurex is called "spread trading." This is when a trader buys one futures contract and sells another one at the same time. The idea is to make money from the difference in prices between the two contracts. For example, if you think the price of wheat will go up more than the price of corn, you could buy a wheat futures contract and sell a corn futures contract. This strategy can help traders manage risk because they are betting on the difference in prices rather than the direction of one price.

Another strategy is "options strategies," which can be more complex but also offer more ways to make money. One common options strategy is called a "straddle," where a trader buys both a call option and a put option on the same product with the same expiration date. This strategy can make money if the price of the product moves a lot in either direction. Traders use this when they think the price will change a lot but are not sure which way it will go. By using Eurex's advanced trading platform, traders can easily set up and manage these kinds of strategies.

## What is a rights issue in finance?

A rights issue in finance is when a company gives its existing shareholders the chance to buy more shares at a lower price than the current market price. This is usually done to raise more money for the company. The company gives these rights to shareholders based on how many shares they already own. For example, if you own 100 shares and the company offers one new share for every two shares owned, you can buy 50 new shares.

The main reason a company might do a rights issue is to get more money without taking on debt. This money can be used for things like expanding the business, paying off debts, or funding new projects. However, a rights issue can also make the value of each share go down because there are more shares now. Shareholders need to decide if they want to buy the new shares or sell their rights to someone else who wants to buy them.

## Why do companies issue rights to their shareholders?

Companies issue rights to their shareholders mainly to raise money without borrowing. When a company needs cash for things like growing the business, paying off debts, or starting new projects, they can offer their current shareholders the chance to buy more shares at a lower price. This is a good way for the company to get the money it needs directly from its investors, rather than taking out loans which they would have to pay back with interest.

However, issuing rights can also affect the value of the company's shares. When more shares are created and sold, the value of each share might go down because the ownership of the company is spread out over more shares. Shareholders have to decide if they want to buy the new shares to keep their same level of ownership, or if they want to sell their rights to someone else. This can be a tricky decision, but it gives shareholders a chance to either invest more in the company or make a bit of money by selling their rights.

## How does a rights issue affect the stock price of a company?

When a company does a rights issue, it usually makes the stock price go down at first. This happens because the company is selling new shares at a lower price than what the shares are currently worth on the market. When more shares are added, the value of each share goes down because the company's total value is now spread over more shares. So, if you own shares, they might be worth less right after a rights issue.

However, the long-term effect on the stock price depends on what the company does with the money it raises. If the company uses the money well, like to grow the business or pay off debts, the stock price might go up over time. But if the company doesn't use the money in a good way, the stock price might stay low or even go down more. So, a rights issue can be good or bad for the stock price, depending on how the company spends the new money.

## What is the difference between a rights issue and a public offering?

A rights issue and a public offering are two ways a company can raise money by selling shares, but they work differently. In a rights issue, the company offers new shares only to its current shareholders. They get the chance to buy these shares at a lower price than the market price, based on how many shares they already own. This means existing shareholders have the first chance to keep their ownership level in the company the same by buying more shares.

On the other hand, a public offering, also called an IPO (Initial Public Offering) if it's the first time the company is selling shares to the public, is when a company sells shares to anyone who wants to buy them. This can include the general public, not just existing shareholders. The price of the shares in a public offering is usually set at what the company thinks the market will pay, which might be higher than the price in a rights issue.

Both methods help a company raise money, but they affect shareholders and the stock price differently. A rights issue can dilute the value of existing shares but gives current shareholders a chance to invest more. A public offering can bring in new investors and might increase the company's visibility and value, but it doesn't give existing shareholders any special rights to buy the new shares.

## How can shareholders participate in a rights issue?

Shareholders can participate in a rights issue by buying the new shares that the company is offering. The company will tell shareholders how many new shares they can buy based on how many shares they already own. For example, if the company says you can buy one new share for every two shares you own, and you have 100 shares, you can buy 50 new shares. The company will also say how much each new share costs, which is usually less than what the shares are worth on the market.

If a shareholder decides to buy the new shares, they need to follow the instructions from the company, which might include filling out a form and sending money by a certain date. If a shareholder doesn't want to buy the new shares, they can sell their rights to someone else who wants to buy them. This way, they can still get some money from the rights issue without buying more shares. Shareholders need to decide quickly because there is usually a short time to act before the rights expire.

## What happens if a shareholder does not exercise their rights?

If a shareholder does not exercise their rights, they will not buy the new shares that the company is offering. This means they will not put more money into the company and their ownership percentage in the company will go down. When the company issues new shares, the total number of shares goes up, so if a shareholder does not buy any of the new shares, they will own a smaller piece of the company than before.

Sometimes, shareholders can sell their rights to other people who want to buy the new shares. If they do this, they can still get some money from the rights issue without having to buy more shares themselves. But if they don't sell their rights either, they will just lose the chance to do anything with them, and their rights will expire without giving them any benefit.

## What are the potential risks and benefits for shareholders in a rights issue?

When a company does a rights issue, shareholders have a chance to buy more shares at a lower price than what they're worth on the market. This can be good because it lets them increase their ownership in the company without spending as much money. If the company uses the money from the rights issue well, like to grow the business or pay off debts, the value of the shares might go up over time. Shareholders can also sell their rights to other people who want to buy the new shares, which can give them a bit of extra money.

But there are risks too. If a shareholder doesn't buy the new shares, their ownership in the company will go down because there are more shares now. This can make each share worth less right away. Also, if the company doesn't use the money from the rights issue in a good way, the share price might stay low or even drop more. So, shareholders need to think carefully about whether to buy the new shares or sell their rights, because it can affect how much their investment is worth in the future.

## How is the subscription price determined in a rights issue?

The subscription price in a rights issue is the price that shareholders have to pay for each new share. This price is usually set lower than the current market price of the shares. The company decides on this price by thinking about what they need to raise money and what will make shareholders want to buy the new shares. They might look at the current stock price and decide on a discount that seems fair to encourage shareholders to participate.

Sometimes, the company might also think about how much money they need to raise and how many new shares they want to issue. They will do some math to figure out a price that works for both the company's goals and the shareholders' interests. The subscription price is important because it affects how many shareholders will want to buy the new shares and how much money the company will raise from the rights issue.

## What are the legal and regulatory considerations for a rights issue?

When a company decides to do a rights issue, it has to follow a lot of rules set by the government and other groups that watch over businesses. These rules are there to make sure the company is honest and fair to its shareholders. The company has to tell everyone about the rights issue in a clear way, usually by sending a document called a prospectus to all shareholders. This document explains how the rights issue works, how many new shares are being offered, and at what price. The company also has to get the rights issue approved by a group like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the U.S., or a similar group in other countries, to make sure everything is done right.

Besides these big rules, there are also smaller ones that the company has to follow. For example, they have to make sure the rights issue is open for a certain amount of time so shareholders have enough time to decide what to do. They also have to be careful about how they talk about the rights issue to the public, so they don't say anything that could trick people into making the wrong choice. If the company doesn't follow all these rules, they could get in trouble and might have to pay fines or face other problems. So, it's really important for them to do everything the right way.

## How does a rights issue impact the company's financial structure?

A rights issue changes the way a company's money is set up. When a company does a rights issue, it gets more money from selling new shares to its shareholders. This money can be used to pay off debts, start new projects, or grow the business. By getting money this way, the company doesn't have to borrow as much, which means it doesn't have to pay back as much money with interest later. So, the company's financial structure can become healthier because it has less debt and more cash to use.

But a rights issue also changes how the company's ownership is split up. When more shares are sold, the total number of shares goes up. This means each share is worth a smaller piece of the company. If shareholders don't buy the new shares, their ownership in the company gets smaller. This can affect how much control they have over the company. Also, if the company doesn't use the new money well, the value of the shares might go down, which can make the company's financial structure weaker in the long run. So, a rights issue can help the company in some ways, but it also comes with risks that need to be thought about carefully.

## What are some real-world examples of successful rights issues?

One good example of a successful rights issue is when Rolls-Royce did one in 2020. They needed money because the airplane industry was having a hard time because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rolls-Royce offered new shares to their shareholders at a lower price than the market price. A lot of shareholders bought the new shares, and the company raised about 2 billion pounds. They used this money to pay off debts and keep the business going during tough times. The rights issue helped Rolls-Royce stay strong and recover when things got better.

Another example is when Lloyds Banking Group did a rights issue in 2009. The financial crisis was making things hard for banks, and Lloyds needed money to stay safe. They offered new shares to their shareholders at a lower price, and many shareholders bought them. Lloyds raised about 13.5 billion pounds. They used this money to make their financial structure stronger and to keep helping their customers. The rights issue helped Lloyds get through the crisis and come out stronger on the other side.

## How do rights issues vary across different jurisdictions and market conditions?

Rights issues can be different in different countries because each place has its own rules and ways of doing things. In the United States, companies have to follow rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and make sure they give shareholders all the information they need in a clear way. In Europe, the rules might be different, and companies might have to follow rules from the European Union or their own country's rules. For example, in the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) watches over rights issues. These rules can affect how long shareholders have to decide what to do with their rights, how the price of the new shares is set, and how the company talks about the rights issue to the public.

Market conditions also play a big role in how rights issues work. When the stock market is doing well, and people feel good about the economy, shareholders might be more likely to buy new shares because they think the company will do well. But if the market is not doing well, like during a recession, shareholders might be more careful and less likely to spend money on new shares. This can make it harder for companies to raise the money they need. Companies have to think about these things when they decide to do a rights issue and set the price of the new shares to make sure it works out well for them and their shareholders.

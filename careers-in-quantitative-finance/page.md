```python
import pandas as pd

def get_trading_signals(data):
    data['50_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
    data['200_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()
    data['Signal'] = 0
    data['Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['50_MA'][50:] > data['200_MA'][50:], 1, 0)
    data['Positions'] = data['Signal'].diff()
    return data

# Assuming 'data' is a DataFrame with a 'Close' column
trading_signals = get_trading_signals(data)
```

Algorithmic trading offers unparalleled speed and efficiency by facilitating high-frequency trading ([HFT](/wiki/high-frequency-trading-strategies)), allowing hundreds or thousands of trades per second.

Learning stock trading strategies requires a systematic approach and lots of practice. Here's an action plan for mastering stock trading strategies:

1. **Formal education**:
    - **Books**: There are many classic books on the subject, such as Benjamin Graham's "The Intelligent Stock Trader" or William O'Neil's "How to Win with Stocks".
    - **Online courses**: Many websites offer courses on stock trading, such as Coursera, Udemy, or specialized platforms like Investopedia Academy.
2. **Join a community**:
    - Trading forums, social media groups and discussion platforms can be excellent resources for learning from other traders, sharing experiences and asking questions.
3. **Start with a Demo Account**:
    - Before investing real money, practice with a demo account or trading simulator. This will allow you to test your strategies risk-free.
4. **Fundamental and Technical Analysis**:
    - Learn fundamental analysis, which examines a company's fundamentals (such as earnings, debt, growth) to determine its intrinsic value.
    - Familiarize yourself with technical analysis, which relies on past price and volume movements to forecast future movements.
5. **Stay Informed**:
    - Follow financial news through reputable sources such as Bloomberg, Reuters, or the Financial Times. This will help you understand the impact of world events on the markets.
6. **Study the Great Figures**:
    - Read about famous traders such as Warren Buffett, George Soros or Jesse Livermore to understand their philosophies and approaches to the market.
7. **Trading Journal**:
    - Keep a trading journal where you write down all your trades, your reasons for entry and exit, and your thoughts. It's an invaluable tool for self-assessment and continuous improvement.
8. **Risk management**:
    - A trading strategy wouldn't be complete without proper risk management. Learn to set stop losses, diversify your portfolio and never invest money you can't afford to lose.
9. **Continuing Education**:
    - The world of finance is constantly evolving. It's crucial to keep learning, whether by reading new books, attending seminars or taking advanced courses.
10. **Avoid "Gurus" Promising Quick Riches**:
    - Beware of people promising unrealistic returns or trying to sell trading "secrets". Successful trading takes time, education and patience.

Finally, it's important to remember that trading involves risk. Even the best traders experience periods of loss. Success depends not only on strategy, but also on psychology, discipline and the ability to manage emotions.

For instance, incorporating historical volatility data into algorithms can help in dynamically adjusting the parameters for trade execution, thus enhancing profitability. One can use Python to implement such strategies:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample volatility-adjusted arbitrage strategy
def volatility_adjusted_arbitrage(prices, vol, threshold=0.02):
    """
    Implement a basic volatility-adjusted arbitrage strategy.
    :param prices: A dataframe with market prices.
    :param vol: A numpy array with historical volatilities.
    :param threshold: Price discrepancy threshold for executing trades.
    :return: List of trades.
    """
    trades = []
    # Calculate price spreads
    spread = prices.diff()

    # Volatility-adjusted threshold for trading signals
    adjusted_threshold = np.mean(vol) * threshold

    # Generate trade signals
    for i in range(1, len(spread)):
        if spread[i] > adjusted_threshold:
            trades.append('Sell')
        elif spread[i] < -adjusted_threshold:
            trades.append('Buy')
        else:
            trades.append('Hold')

    return trades

# Example usage
prices = pd.Series([1500, 1505, 1510, 1508, 1512])
vol = np.array([0.01, 0.02, 0.015, 0.03, 0.02])
trades = volatility_adjusted_arbitrage(prices, vol)
print(trades)
```

In summary, the layered complexities of algorithmic trading for precious metals arbitrage necessitate a blend of speedy execution, cost management, volatility mitigation, and regulatory compliance. A sophisticated approach that leverages real-time data analysis and advanced algorithms can help mitigate these risks and enhance profitability.

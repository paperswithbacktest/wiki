## What is a data broker?

A data broker is a company that collects and sells information about people. This information can include things like names, addresses, phone numbers, and even details about what people buy or where they go online. Data brokers gather this data from many different places, like public records, websites, and other companies. They then organize and sell this information to other businesses that want to learn more about their customers or potential customers.

These businesses might use the data to send targeted ads, make decisions about offering services, or even to assess risks. For example, a company might buy data to figure out which customers are likely to buy certain products. While data brokers can help businesses understand their markets better, there are concerns about privacy. People often don't know that their information is being collected and sold, and they might not be comfortable with how it's being used. This has led to calls for more rules to protect personal information.

## What is alternative data?

Alternative data is information that companies use to learn more about their business or the market, but it's not the usual stuff like financial reports. Instead, it can come from places like social media posts, satellite images, or even data from smartphones. Companies use this kind of data to find out things they wouldn't know otherwise, like how many people are visiting a store or what people are saying about a new product online.

Using [alternative data](/wiki/best-alternative-data) can give businesses an edge because it helps them see trends or changes before others do. For example, a company might look at weather data to guess how much ice cream they'll sell, or they might use location data to see where people are going on weekends. But there are also worries about privacy and how this data is collected and used. People might not know that their information is being tracked and sold, so it's important for companies to be careful and follow rules about using this data.

## How do data brokers use alternative data?

Data brokers use alternative data to make the information they sell more valuable and detailed. They collect things like social media posts, location data from smartphones, and even satellite images. By adding this alternative data to the usual information they gather, like names and addresses, data brokers can create a fuller picture of what people do and like. This helps them sell more useful information to businesses that want to understand their customers better.

For example, a data broker might use location data to see where people go shopping and then sell this information to a store. The store can use this to decide where to open new locations or what products to stock. But using alternative data also raises concerns about privacy. People often don't know that their everyday activities are being tracked and sold. This has led to calls for stricter rules to protect personal information and make sure it's used fairly.

## What are the common sources of alternative data?

Alternative data comes from many places that you might not think of as data sources. For example, social media posts can tell companies what people are talking about or what they like. Location data from smartphones can show where people go, like to shops or restaurants. Even satellite images can be used to see how busy a parking lot is, which might tell a company how well a store is doing.

Another source of alternative data is web scraping, where companies collect information from websites. This can include things like prices from online stores or reviews from customers. Credit card transactions are also used because they show what people are buying and where they're spending their money. All these sources help companies learn more about what's happening in the world around them.

But there are also other sources like weather data, which can help predict how much of certain products people might buy. For example, if it's going to be hot, companies might expect more sales of ice cream. Sensor data from devices like fitness trackers can show how active people are, and even data from job postings can tell companies about the job market. All these different kinds of data help businesses make better decisions.

## What are the benefits of using alternative data for businesses?

Using alternative data helps businesses learn more about what people want and how the world is changing. For example, by looking at social media posts, a company can find out what people think about their products. Location data from smartphones can show where people go shopping, which helps stores decide where to open new locations. This kind of information can give businesses a big advantage because they can see trends and changes before others do. This means they can make better decisions about what to sell, where to sell it, and how to reach their customers.

But there's more to it than just understanding customers. Alternative data can also help businesses manage risks better. For instance, by looking at weather data, a company can predict how much of certain products they might need. Satellite images can show how busy a store is, which helps companies understand if their marketing is working. All these different kinds of data help businesses be more prepared and make smarter choices. This can lead to saving money, growing faster, and being more successful in the long run.

## What are the potential risks and ethical concerns associated with data brokers and alternative data?

Using data brokers and alternative data can lead to some big problems, especially when it comes to privacy. People often don't know that their information is being collected and sold. This can make them feel like their privacy is being invaded. It's not just about feeling uncomfortable; it can also be dangerous if the wrong people get hold of personal information. For example, if someone's location data is sold, it could be used to follow them or even steal their identity. This is why many people are worried about how data brokers use and share alternative data.

There are also ethical concerns about how fair it is to use this kind of data. Some people might not have the same protections as others, and their information could be used in ways that harm them. For instance, if a company uses social media data to decide who to hire, it might unfairly judge people based on what they post online. This can lead to discrimination and unfair treatment. Because of these risks and concerns, there's a growing call for stricter rules to make sure data brokers and companies using alternative data do so in a way that's fair and respects people's privacy.

## How can alternative data be used to gain a competitive advantage?

Alternative data can help businesses get ahead of their competition by giving them information that others might not have. For example, a company can look at social media to see what people are saying about their products or their competitors' products. This can help them understand what customers like or don't like, and they can change their products or marketing to be better. Location data from smartphones can show where people go shopping, so a store can decide where to open new locations to be closer to where people are already going.

Using alternative data also helps businesses see trends and changes before others do. For example, weather data can help a company predict how much ice cream they might sell on a hot day, so they can make sure they have enough in stock. Satellite images can show how busy a store's parking lot is, which helps companies understand if their marketing is working or if they need to do something different. By using this kind of data, businesses can make smarter choices and stay one step ahead of their competitors.

## What are the key differences between traditional data and alternative data?

Traditional data is the kind of information that businesses have been using for a long time. It includes things like financial reports, sales numbers, and customer surveys. This data is usually collected by the company itself or bought from well-known sources like government reports. Traditional data helps businesses understand how they are doing and make decisions based on clear numbers and facts.

Alternative data, on the other hand, comes from newer and less traditional places. It can include things like social media posts, location data from smartphones, and even satellite images. This kind of data can tell businesses about what people are doing and thinking in real time, which can help them see trends and changes before others do. While traditional data is more straightforward and easier to understand, alternative data can give businesses a more complete picture of the world around them.

## What regulations govern the use of alternative data by data brokers?

In the United States, the use of alternative data by data brokers is governed by several laws, but there isn't one main law that covers everything. One important law is the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which says that data brokers have to be careful if they're selling data that's used to make decisions about things like loans or jobs. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also has rules about privacy and how companies can use and share data. These rules say that companies have to be honest about what they're doing with people's information and protect it from being stolen.

In Europe, there's a stronger law called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This law says that companies have to be very clear about what they're doing with people's data and get permission before they use it. People also have the right to see what data is being collected about them and ask for it to be deleted. These rules make it harder for data brokers to use alternative data without being careful about privacy. Both in the US and Europe, these laws are trying to balance the benefits of using alternative data with the need to protect people's privacy.

## How can companies ensure the quality and reliability of alternative data?

Companies need to check the quality and reliability of alternative data carefully because it comes from many different places. They can do this by looking at where the data comes from and making sure it's from trusted sources. For example, if they're using social media data, they should check that the accounts are real and not fake. Companies can also use special tools to clean up the data and make sure it's accurate. This means getting rid of any wrong or repeated information.

Another way to make sure alternative data is good is by comparing it with other kinds of data. If the alternative data matches up with traditional data like sales numbers, it's more likely to be reliable. Companies can also test the data by using it to make predictions and then seeing if those predictions come true. By doing these things, companies can feel more confident that the alternative data they're using is both high quality and reliable.

## What advanced analytical techniques are used to process and interpret alternative data?

Companies use advanced analytical techniques to make sense of alternative data. One common technique is [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning), which is a kind of computer program that can learn from data and make predictions. For example, machine learning can look at social media posts to guess what people might buy next. Another technique is natural language processing, which helps computers understand and analyze what people are saying in text or speech. This can be useful for understanding customer reviews or comments on social media.

Another important technique is data visualization, which turns complex data into easy-to-understand pictures and charts. This helps people see patterns and trends quickly. Companies also use predictive analytics, which uses data to make guesses about what will happen in the future. For example, predictive analytics can use location data to predict how busy a store will be. By using these techniques, companies can get the most out of alternative data and make better decisions.

## What future trends are expected in the field of data brokers and alternative data?

In the future, data brokers and alternative data are expected to become even more important for businesses. As technology keeps getting better, companies will be able to collect and use more kinds of data. This means they can learn even more about what people want and how the world is changing. For example, with more smart devices and the internet of things, companies will have access to all sorts of new information, like how people use their homes or cars. This can help businesses make better products and services that fit what people need.

However, as data brokers and alternative data grow, so do concerns about privacy. People are worried about how their information is being used and shared. Because of this, there will likely be more rules and laws to protect people's privacy. Companies will have to be more careful about how they collect and use data, and they might need to get people's permission before using their information. Balancing the benefits of using alternative data with the need to protect privacy will be a big challenge in the future.

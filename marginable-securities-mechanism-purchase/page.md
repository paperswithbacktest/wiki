## What are marginable securities?

Marginable securities are stocks, bonds, or other investments that you can buy using borrowed money from your brokerage firm. This borrowed money is called a margin loan. When you use margin to buy securities, you're essentially taking out a loan to invest, which can increase both your potential gains and your potential losses. Not all securities can be bought on margin; they must meet certain criteria set by the brokerage and regulatory bodies like the Federal Reserve.

To be considered marginable, a security usually needs to be liquid, meaning it can be easily bought and sold without affecting its market price too much. Common stocks listed on major exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ are typically marginable. However, some securities, like penny stocks or certain mutual funds, might not be eligible for margin trading due to their higher risk or lower liquidity. Always check with your brokerage firm to see if a specific security is marginable before attempting to trade it on margin.

## How does the margin account work?

A margin account lets you borrow money from your brokerage to buy investments. When you open a margin account, you put in some of your own money, called the initial margin, which is usually around 50% of the total investment cost. The rest is loaned to you by the brokerage. This means you can buy more stocks or other investments than you could with just your own money. But remember, you have to pay interest on the money you borrow, just like with any other loan.

If the value of your investments goes up, you can make more money than if you had only used your own cash. But if the value goes down, you could lose more than you initially invested. This is because you still have to pay back the loan, plus interest. To protect themselves, brokerages have rules called maintenance margins. If your investments drop too much in value, you'll get a margin call, meaning you need to add more money or sell some investments to bring your account back to the required level. It's a way to manage risk, but it can be risky if the market moves against you.

## What are the eligibility criteria for marginable securities?

Marginable securities are investments that you can buy using borrowed money from your brokerage. To be marginable, a security needs to be easy to buy and sell without changing its price too much. This means the security should be liquid. Usually, common stocks listed on big exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ are marginable. These stocks are seen as less risky because they have a lot of buyers and sellers.

However, not all investments can be bought on margin. Some securities, like penny stocks or certain mutual funds, are not marginable because they are riskier or harder to sell quickly. The rules about what can be marginable are set by the brokerage and also by regulatory bodies like the Federal Reserve. Before you can trade a security on margin, you need to check with your brokerage to make sure it's allowed.

## What is the process to purchase marginable securities?

To buy marginable securities, you first need to open a margin account with a brokerage firm. This type of account lets you borrow money from the brokerage to buy investments. When you open the account, you'll need to put in some of your own money, called the initial margin. This is usually about half of the total cost of the investment you want to buy. The rest of the money you need will be loaned to you by the brokerage. You'll have to pay interest on this loan, just like with any other kind of borrowing.

Once your margin account is set up, you can start buying marginable securities. These are usually stocks or bonds that are easy to buy and sell, like those listed on big exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. Before you buy, make sure to check with your brokerage to see if the security you want is marginable. After you buy the securities, you need to keep an eye on their value. If the value drops too much, you might get a margin call, which means you'll need to add more money to your account or sell some investments to meet the brokerage's requirements.

## What are the risks associated with trading on margin?

Trading on margin can be risky because you're borrowing money to buy investments. If the value of your investments goes down, you could lose more than the money you put in. That's because you still have to pay back the loan, plus interest. If your investments drop too much, you might get a margin call. This means you need to add more money to your account or sell some investments quickly to meet the brokerage's rules. If you can't do this, the brokerage might sell your investments to cover the loan, and you could end up losing a lot of money.

Another risk is that you might feel tempted to take bigger risks because you're using borrowed money. This can lead to bad decisions and bigger losses. Also, the interest you pay on the borrowed money can add up over time, eating into any profits you make. So, while trading on margin can help you make more money if things go well, it can also lead to big losses if the market goes against you. It's important to understand these risks and be ready to handle them before you start trading on margin.

## How is the margin requirement calculated?

Margin requirement is the amount of money you need to have in your account to buy investments using borrowed money from your brokerage. When you want to buy a stock or another investment on margin, you usually need to put in about half of the total cost yourself. This is called the initial margin, and it's set by the Federal Reserve at a minimum of 50%. So, if you want to buy $10,000 worth of stock, you would need to put in at least $5,000, and the brokerage would lend you the other $5,000.

After you buy the investment, you need to keep a certain amount of money in your account to cover the loan. This is called the maintenance margin, and it's usually around 25% to 30% of the total value of your investments. If the value of your investments goes down and the money in your account falls below this level, you'll get a margin call. This means you need to put more money into your account or sell some investments to bring your account back up to the required level. If you can't do this, the brokerage might sell your investments to cover the loan.

## What are the differences between marginable and non-marginable securities?

Marginable securities are investments you can buy using borrowed money from your brokerage. This means you can buy more stocks or bonds than you could with just your own money. Common stocks listed on big exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ are usually marginable because they are easy to buy and sell. These securities need to be liquid, meaning they can be sold quickly without changing their price too much. The rules about what can be marginable are set by the brokerage and also by the Federal Reserve.

Non-marginable securities, on the other hand, cannot be bought with borrowed money. These are often riskier or harder to sell quickly, like penny stocks or certain mutual funds. Because they are not as easy to trade, brokerages don't let you use margin to buy them. If you want to buy non-marginable securities, you need to use only your own money. This limits how much you can invest but also protects you from the risks of borrowing to invest.

## How do margin calls work and how can they be managed?

A margin call happens when the value of your investments drops and the money in your account falls below the maintenance margin set by your brokerage. This maintenance margin is usually around 25% to 30% of the total value of your investments. When you get a margin call, you need to add more money to your account or sell some of your investments to bring your account back up to the required level. If you don't do this quickly, the brokerage might sell your investments to cover the loan you took to buy them.

To manage margin calls, you need to keep a close eye on the value of your investments. If the market starts to go down, you might want to add more money to your account before you get a margin call. Another way to manage it is by setting stop-loss orders, which automatically sell your investments if they fall to a certain price. This can help prevent your account from falling below the maintenance margin. It's also a good idea to only borrow what you can afford to pay back, even if the market goes against you.

## What are the regulatory requirements for trading marginable securities?

Trading marginable securities is controlled by rules set by the Federal Reserve and the brokerage firms. The Federal Reserve says you need to put in at least 50% of the total cost of the investment yourself. This is called the initial margin. Brokerage firms can set their own rules too, but they can't go below what the Federal Reserve says. So, if you want to buy $10,000 worth of stock, you need to put in at least $5,000, and the brokerage will lend you the other $5,000.

After you buy the investment, you need to keep a certain amount of money in your account to cover the loan. This is called the maintenance margin, and it's usually around 25% to 30% of the total value of your investments. If the value of your investments goes down and the money in your account falls below this level, you'll get a margin call. This means you need to put more money into your account or sell some investments to bring your account back up to the required level. If you can't do this, the brokerage might sell your investments to cover the loan.

## How can leverage impact investment returns when using marginable securities?

Leverage can make your investment returns bigger when you use marginable securities. When you borrow money from your brokerage to buy investments, you can buy more than you could with just your own money. If the value of your investments goes up, you make more money because you have more investments. For example, if you put in $5,000 and borrow another $5,000 to buy $10,000 worth of stock, and the stock goes up by 10%, you make $1,000. That's a 20% return on your $5,000, which is double what you would have made without borrowing.

But leverage can also make your losses bigger if the value of your investments goes down. If that same $10,000 worth of stock drops by 10%, you lose $1,000. That's a 20% loss on your $5,000, which is also double what you would have lost without borrowing. Plus, you still have to pay back the $5,000 you borrowed, plus interest. So, while leverage can help you make more money when things go well, it can also lead to big losses if the market goes against you.

## What advanced strategies can be employed with marginable securities?

One advanced strategy with marginable securities is called margin trading. This is when you borrow money from your brokerage to buy more stocks or investments than you could with just your own money. If the value of your investments goes up, you can make a lot more money because you have more investments. But it's risky because if the value goes down, you can lose a lot more too. You have to pay back the loan plus interest, so if your investments lose value, you might get a margin call. This means you need to put more money in your account or sell some investments to meet the brokerage's rules.

Another strategy is called short selling. This is when you borrow a stock from your brokerage and sell it, hoping the price will go down. If it does, you can buy the stock back at a lower price, return it to the brokerage, and keep the difference as profit. But if the stock price goes up instead, you lose money because you have to buy it back at a higher price to return it. Short selling is risky because there's no limit to how much the stock price can go up, so your losses could be big. Both margin trading and short selling need careful planning and watching the market closely to manage the risks.

## How do market conditions affect the use of marginable securities?

Market conditions can really change how people use marginable securities. When the market is doing well and stock prices are going up, more people might want to use margin to buy stocks. They think they can make more money because they can buy more stocks than they could with just their own money. But if the market starts to go down, people might be scared to use margin. They don't want to lose more money than they put in because they still have to pay back the loan they took from the brokerage, plus interest.

When the market is very up and down, using margin can be even riskier. If stock prices drop a lot, people might get margin calls. This means they need to put more money into their account or sell some stocks quickly to meet the brokerage's rules. If they can't do this, the brokerage might sell their stocks to cover the loan, and they could lose a lot of money. So, it's important to watch the market closely and be ready for changes when using marginable securities.

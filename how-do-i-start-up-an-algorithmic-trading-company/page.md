Launching an algorithmic trading business is an ambitious project that requires careful planning and rigorous execution. Here's a detailed plan for starting such a business:

#### 1. Feasibility study (1-3 months)

- **Market research**: Analyze the current algorithmic trading market. Who are the major players? What is the size of the market?
- **Niche identification**: Look for less saturated sectors or markets where you can add value.
- **Financial study**: Estimate the capital required to start up and operate, forecast costs, and expected revenues.

#### 2. Business plan and strategy (2-4 months) **Mission and vision**: Define your mission and vision.

- **Mission and vision**: Clearly define what you want to achieve.
- **Strategy**: How will you operate? What algorithms or trading strategies do you plan to use?
- **Organizational structure**: Who are the key team members? What roles will they play?

#### 3. Legal and regulatory framework (3-6 months) **Choosing the legal form

- **Choice of legal form**: For example, SARL, SAS, etc.
- **Licenses and regulations** : Trading is highly regulated. Make sure you obtain all necessary licenses.
- **Protection**: Put measures in place to protect your algorithms and intellectual property.

#### 4. Fundraising (4-8 months)

- **Search for investors**: Identify potential financial partners or investors.
- **Project presentation**: Create a solid pitch to present to potential investors.

#### 5. Set up the infrastructure (5-10 months) **Technology**: Invest in the technology.

- **Technology**: Invest in high-performance servers, trading platforms and other technological tools.
- **Security**: Establish measures to guarantee the security of your systems against external attacks and internal failures.
- **Test**: Test your infrastructure to ensure that it runs flawlessly.

#### *6. Algorithm development and testing (8-14 months)

- **Development**: Write the codes for your algorithms. Make sure they are optimized for performance.
- **Backtesting**: Test your algorithms on historical data to see how they would have performed.
- **Optimization**: Based on the results of backtesting, make any necessary modifications.

#### 7. Launch and operation (12-18 months)

- **Pilot phase**: Start trading with a small amount of capital to test your algorithms in real-life conditions.
- **Evaluation and adjustment**: Based on the results of the pilot, make any necessary adjustments.
- **Full-scale operation**: Once you are satisfied with the performance, increase your trading volume.

#### 8. Ongoing evaluation (Post 18 months)

- **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the performance of your algorithms.
- **Adaptation**: Markets are constantly changing. Be ready to adapt or modify your algorithms accordingly.
- **Expand**: Explore new opportunities or markets to expand your business.

Starting an [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) business requires a combination of trading, programming and business management skills. It's a competitive field, but with proper planning and solid execution, it's possible to succeed.

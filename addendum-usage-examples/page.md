Additionally, the precision of algo trading reduces the likelihood of errors that are prevalent in manual trading and allows traders to analyze and act upon large datasets instantaneously, thus improving market efficiency.

Key strategies employed in [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) include:

1. **Arbitrage**: This strategy seeks to benefit from price discrepancies of a security across different markets or forms. By rapidly buying and selling the security in multiple markets, algorithms can secure profits before the price variance resolves.

2. **Trend Following**: A trend-following algorithm attempts to capitalize on upward or downward market trends. By analyzing historical price data, these algorithms identify ongoing trends and execute trades in the direction of the trend.

3. **Market Making**: This strategy involves placing buy and sell orders on market listings to capture the spread between the bid and ask prices. Market-making algorithms help enhance liquidity and improve the efficiency of financial markets.

Despite its advantages, algorithmic trading is not without challenges. Technical failures, such as software bugs and hardware issues, pose significant risks. These failures can lead to substantial financial losses if not swiftly identified and corrected. Furthermore, the unpredictable nature of markets can render pre-programmed algorithms less effective, especially in volatile conditions.

## What is the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI)?

The Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) is a research center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. It focuses on studying how economic policies affect people and the environment. PERI was started in 1998 and works to find solutions to big problems like poverty, inequality, and climate change.

Researchers at PERI look at how different policies can help or hurt people and the planet. They study things like jobs, wages, and how to make the economy more fair. PERI also works with governments and organizations around the world to help them make better decisions. Their goal is to use research to make the world a better place for everyone.

## Where is PERI located and who founded it?

PERI is located at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in Amherst, Massachusetts. This is a place where students go to learn and where researchers work to find out new things.

PERI was started in 1998 by a group of people who wanted to study how economic policies affect people and the environment. One of the main founders was Robert Pollin, an economist who wanted to use research to help solve big problems like poverty and climate change.

## What are the main research areas of PERI?

PERI focuses on studying how economic policies affect people and the environment. They look at things like jobs, wages, and how to make the economy more fair. One big area they study is how to create good jobs that pay well and help the environment. They also look at how to make sure everyone has a fair chance to succeed, no matter where they come from or how much money they have.

Another important area for PERI is figuring out how to fight climate change. They study ways to use less energy and make it cleaner, so it doesn't hurt the planet as much. PERI also looks at how to help workers and communities that might be affected by changes in the economy, like when old industries close down and new ones start up.

Overall, PERI's research is all about finding ways to make the world a better place. They want to help people live better lives and take care of the environment at the same time. By studying these big issues, PERI hopes to give governments and organizations around the world good ideas for making smart decisions.

## Can you describe some key projects or studies conducted by PERI?

One key project that PERI worked on is called the Green New Deal. This project looked at how to create jobs that help the environment. PERI researchers studied ways to make energy cleaner and use less of it. They found that by investing in things like wind and solar power, we could create millions of good jobs while also fighting climate change. This research has helped policymakers think about how to make the economy greener and more fair at the same time.

Another important study by PERI looked at how to make wages more fair. They studied the effects of raising the minimum wage and found that it could help a lot of people without hurting the economy. PERI's research showed that when people earn more, they spend more, which can actually help businesses. This study has been used by governments to think about how to make sure everyone earns enough to live a good life.

PERI also did a project on how to help communities when old industries close down. They looked at places where factories or mines shut down and studied how to create new jobs and support people during these changes. Their research showed that by investing in education and new industries, communities could recover and even do better than before. This work has helped policymakers plan for the future and make sure no one is left behind when the economy changes.

## How does PERI collaborate with other institutions or organizations?

PERI works with other schools and groups to do research and share ideas. They team up with universities around the world to study big problems like climate change and how to make the economy more fair. By working together, they can learn from each other and come up with better solutions. For example, PERI might work with a university in another country to study how to create good jobs that help the environment. This helps them understand what works in different places and how to make policies that work everywhere.

PERI also works with governments and organizations to help them make better decisions. They share their research with policymakers so they can use it to make laws and plans that help people and the planet. For instance, PERI might work with a government to study how to raise wages without hurting the economy. By working together, they can make sure the policies are based on good research and will really help people. This kind of teamwork helps PERI have a bigger impact and make the world a better place.

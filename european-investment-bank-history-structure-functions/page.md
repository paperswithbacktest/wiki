## What is the European Investment Bank?

The European Investment Bank (EIB) is a bank owned by the countries in the European Union. It helps to fund projects that can help the economy and improve people's lives. The EIB gives loans to businesses, cities, and countries to help them build things like roads, hospitals, and schools. It also helps to fund projects that are good for the environment, like renewable energy.

The EIB is different from other banks because it doesn't try to make a profit. Instead, it focuses on helping the European Union achieve its goals. These goals include fighting climate change, supporting small businesses, and helping less wealthy regions grow. The bank gets its money from investors who want to support these goals, and it uses this money to make loans at low interest rates.

## When was the European Investment Bank founded?

The European Investment Bank was founded in 1958. This was the same year that the Treaty of Rome was signed, which created the European Economic Community. The EIB was set up to help this new community grow and develop.

The bank started with six member countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Over time, as more countries joined the European Union, they also became part of the EIB. Today, the bank helps fund projects all over Europe and even in other parts of the world.

## What are the primary objectives of the European Investment Bank?

The European Investment Bank has a few main goals. One big goal is to help the European Union grow and become stronger. It does this by giving money to projects that can help the economy. These projects can be things like building roads, hospitals, or schools. The EIB wants to make sure that all parts of Europe, especially the poorer areas, can grow and develop.

Another important goal of the EIB is to help protect the environment. The bank gives money to projects that use renewable energy, like wind or solar power. It also supports projects that help fight climate change. The EIB wants to make sure that Europe is a leader in taking care of the planet.

The EIB also works to support small businesses and help them grow. It gives loans to these businesses so they can start up or expand. This helps create jobs and makes the economy stronger. Overall, the EIB's main objectives are to help the economy grow, protect the environment, and support small businesses.

## How is the European Investment Bank structured?

The European Investment Bank has a simple structure. At the top is the Board of Governors, which includes finance ministers from all the countries in the European Union. They meet once a year to set the bank's overall direction and approve its financial statements. Below the Board of Governors is the Board of Directors, made up of people chosen by the member countries. This board meets often to make decisions about loans and other important issues.

The day-to-day work of the EIB is done by the Management Committee. This group of people is led by the President of the EIB, who is chosen by the Board of Governors. The Management Committee is in charge of running the bank and making sure it follows the goals set by the Board of Governors and the Board of Directors. There are also many staff members who work in different departments to help with the bank's operations, like giving out loans and checking on projects.

## Who are the members of the European Investment Bank?

The members of the European Investment Bank are the same as the countries in the European Union. Right now, there are 27 countries that are part of the EIB. These countries include big ones like Germany and France, and smaller ones like Malta and Luxembourg. Each country has a say in how the bank is run and what projects it supports.

Every country in the EIB gets to have a representative on the Board of Governors. This group meets once a year to make big decisions about the bank. They also choose people to be on the Board of Directors, which meets more often to decide on things like loans. This way, all the countries work together to make sure the bank is doing a good job and helping the whole European Union.

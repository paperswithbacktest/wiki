## What is Algorithmic Trading?

Algorithmic trading encompasses the use of computer algorithms to automate the execution of trades, enabling transactions to be completed at optimal speeds and prices. This method of trading removes the emotional and intuitive biases that typically affect human traders, replacing them with systematic, data-driven decisions based on mathematical models. These algorithms can analyze a vast array of variables to make swift trading decisions, leveraging computational power to process large volumes of trades efficiently and consistently.

High-frequency trading (HFT), a subset of algorithmic trading, embodies strategies that execute a large number of orders at extremely high speeds. The capacity of algorithmic systems to analyze market data and execute orders in milliseconds facilitates this high-frequency approach, offering traders opportunities to capitalize on minute price discrepancies.

The inception of algorithmic trading can be traced back to the early 1970s when the New York Stock Exchange began adopting electronic trading systems. Over the decades, the role of algorithmic trading in financial markets has expanded significantly. As of today, it accounts for a substantial portion of the total trading [volume](/wiki/volume-trading-strategy) across global markets. The appeal of algorithmic trading lies in its ability to evaluate and exploit market opportunities more swiftly than any human could.

Key to the operational success of [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) is its capacity to handle and analyze extensive datasets at lightning speed. Algorithms are designed to detect patterns and correlations within these datasets, often deploying [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning) techniques to enhance predictive accuracy. The efficiency and precision provided by algorithmic trading systems have redefined how trading is conducted, highlighting the advanced integration of technology within the financial sector.

As financial markets grow more complex, algorithmic trading continues to evolve, driving deeper integration with emerging technologies and fostering innovation across markets globally.

import numpy as np

# Fetch historical stock data
def fetch_data(stock_symbol):
    # Here, you can use libraries like yfinance to get historical data
    # For demonstration purposes, we'll use a placeholder
    data = pd.DataFrame({
        'Date': pd.date_range(start='2022-01-01', periods=100),
        'Close': np.random.rand(100) * 100
    })
    data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)
    return data

# Moving average crossover strategy
def moving_average_crossover(data):
    short_window = 40
    long_window = 100

    # Compute moving averages
    data['Short_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    data['Long_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

    # Generate signals
    data['Signal'] = 0
    data['Signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['Short_MA'][short_window:] > data['Long_MA'][short_window:], 1, 0)

    # Calculate trading positions
    data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()
    return data

# Example usage
data = fetch_data('AAPL')
result = moving_average_crossover(data)
print(result.head())
```

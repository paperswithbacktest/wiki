## What is a shareholder?

A shareholder is someone who owns a part of a company. They own this part by buying shares or stocks of the company. When you buy shares, you are investing money in the company, and in return, you get a piece of ownership. This ownership can give shareholders a say in how the company is run, depending on how many shares they own.

Shareholders can also earn money from the company in two main ways. First, they can get dividends, which are payments made by the company to its shareholders from its profits. Second, if the value of the shares goes up, shareholders can sell their shares for more money than they paid for them. This is called capital gain. However, if the company does not do well, the value of the shares can go down, and shareholders might lose money.

## What are the basic rights of a shareholder?

Shareholders have some basic rights because they own part of a company. One of the main rights is the right to vote at shareholder meetings. This means they can help decide important things like who will be on the company's board of directors and whether to approve big changes in the company. The number of votes a shareholder gets usually depends on how many shares they own. The more shares, the more votes.

Another right shareholders have is to get information about the company. This includes financial reports and other important documents that show how the company is doing. Shareholders can use this information to make smart decisions about their investment. If they think the company is doing well, they might want to buy more shares. If they think it's not doing well, they might want to sell their shares.

Shareholders also have the right to receive dividends if the company decides to pay them. Dividends are a share of the company's profits given to shareholders. Not all companies pay dividends, but when they do, it's a way for shareholders to earn money from their investment without selling their shares. If a company is ever sold or liquidated, shareholders also have a right to get a part of any money left over, after all debts are paid.

## How do shareholders influence a company?

Shareholders influence a company mainly through voting at meetings. They get to vote on important things like who should be on the board of directors. The board makes big decisions for the company, so choosing the right people is important. Shareholders with more shares have more votes, so they can have a bigger say in these decisions. This way, shareholders can guide the company in the direction they think is best.

Another way shareholders influence a company is by buying and selling shares. If many shareholders think the company is doing well, they might buy more shares, which can make the share price go up. This can make the company look good to others and attract more investment. On the other hand, if shareholders think the company is not doing well, they might sell their shares, which can make the share price go down. This can pressure the company to make changes to improve its performance. So, by deciding to buy or sell, shareholders can show what they think about the company and push it to do better.

## What is the difference between common and preferred shareholders?

Common shareholders and preferred shareholders are both owners of a company, but they have different rights and benefits. Common shareholders usually get one vote per share at shareholder meetings. This means they can vote on important decisions like choosing the board of directors. Common shareholders might also get dividends, but these are not guaranteed. If the company makes money, they might share in the profits. If the company goes bankrupt and is liquidated, common shareholders are the last to get any money left over, after everyone else is paid.

Preferred shareholders have some advantages over common shareholders. The main one is that they usually get dividends before common shareholders. These dividends are often a fixed amount and are more likely to be paid out regularly. Preferred shareholders usually don't get to vote at shareholder meetings, so they have less say in how the company is run. If the company goes bankrupt, preferred shareholders get paid before common shareholders but after the company's debts are settled. So, while preferred shareholders have less control over the company, they have more security when it comes to getting dividends and getting money back if the company fails.

## What are voting rights and how do they work?

Voting rights are what shareholders use to help make big decisions in a company. Each share a shareholder owns usually gives them one vote. This means the more shares someone owns, the more votes they have. Shareholders vote at meetings called shareholder meetings. At these meetings, they can vote on things like who should be on the board of directors, which is a group of people who make important decisions for the company. They might also vote on big changes to the company, like merging with another company or changing the company's rules.

Voting can happen in different ways. Sometimes shareholders go to the meeting in person and vote by raising their hands or using a voting machine. Other times, they can vote by sending in a form called a proxy before the meeting. This lets them vote without being there. The votes are counted, and the decision with the most votes wins. This way, shareholders can have a say in how the company is run, even if they can't all be at the meeting.

## Can shareholders receive dividends and how are they determined?

Shareholders can receive dividends, which are payments made by a company to its shareholders from its profits. Not all companies pay dividends, though. Some companies might choose to use their profits to grow the business instead of paying them out. If a company does decide to pay dividends, it usually does this a few times a year. The board of directors decides how much the dividend will be and when it will be paid.

The amount of dividends a shareholder gets depends on how many shares they own. If you own more shares, you get more dividends. For example, if a company decides to pay a dividend of $1 per share, and you own 100 shares, you would get $100. Sometimes, the amount of the dividend can change. It might go up if the company is doing well and making more profit, or it might go down if the company is not doing as well.

## What is a shareholder meeting and why is it important?

A shareholder meeting is a gathering where people who own shares in a company come together to talk about and vote on important things. These meetings can happen once a year, called an annual general meeting, or more often if there are big decisions to make. At these meetings, shareholders can vote on who should be on the board of directors, which is a group of people who help run the company. They might also vote on big changes, like if the company should merge with another company or change its rules.

These meetings are important because they give shareholders a chance to have a say in how the company is run. Since shareholders own part of the company, they want to make sure it's being managed well. By voting at these meetings, they can help guide the company in the direction they think is best. It's also a time for shareholders to ask questions and get information about how the company is doing, which helps them decide if they want to keep their shares or maybe buy more or sell some.

## How can shareholders impact corporate governance?

Shareholders can impact corporate governance by voting at shareholder meetings. They get to vote on who should be on the board of directors, which is a group of people who make big decisions for the company. If shareholders think the company is not being run well, they can vote for new people to be on the board. This way, they can help make sure the company is managed in a way that they think is good. The more shares a shareholder owns, the more votes they have, so big shareholders can have a bigger say in these decisions.

Shareholders can also impact corporate governance by buying and selling shares. If many shareholders think the company is doing well, they might buy more shares, which can make the share price go up. This can show others that the company is being run well and attract more investment. On the other hand, if shareholders think the company is not doing well, they might sell their shares, which can make the share price go down. This can put pressure on the company to make changes to improve how it's being run. So, by deciding to buy or sell, shareholders can show what they think about the company and push it to do better.

## What are preemptive rights and why are they important?

Preemptive rights are a special right that some shareholders have. It means that if the company wants to sell new shares, these shareholders get the first chance to buy them. This helps them keep their ownership percentage in the company the same. If they didn't have this right, the company could sell new shares to other people, and the original shareholders' ownership would get smaller.

These rights are important because they protect shareholders from having their ownership diluted. Dilution happens when new shares are sold and the total number of shares goes up, making each share worth a smaller piece of the company. By giving shareholders the first chance to buy new shares, preemptive rights help them keep their say in the company the same. This can be very important for shareholders who want to keep control over the company's decisions.

## What legal protections do shareholders have?

Shareholders have some legal protections to help keep their rights safe. One big protection is the right to get information about the company. This means the company has to share important documents like financial reports with shareholders. This helps them know how the company is doing and make good choices about their shares. Another protection is the right to vote at shareholder meetings. This lets shareholders have a say in big decisions, like who should be on the board of directors. They can vote to make sure the company is run well.

Shareholders also have the right to take legal action if they think the company is doing something wrong. This is called a shareholder lawsuit. If shareholders believe the company's leaders are not acting in the best interest of the company, they can go to court to try to fix the problem. These protections help make sure that shareholders are treated fairly and can trust that the company is being run honestly.

## How do shareholders exercise their right to inspect company books and records?

Shareholders have the right to look at the company's [books](/wiki/algo-trading-books) and records. This means they can ask to see important documents like financial reports. These documents show how the company is doing, which helps shareholders make good decisions about their shares. To look at these records, shareholders usually need to send a written request to the company. They might have to give a good reason for wanting to see the records, like if they think something is wrong with how the company is being run.

Once the request is made, the company has to let the shareholder see the records. The company might set up a time for the shareholder to come and look at the documents at the company's office. Sometimes, the shareholder can even get copies of the records, but there might be a small fee for this. This right to inspect the books and records is important because it helps shareholders keep an eye on the company and make sure everything is being done correctly.

## What advanced strategies can shareholders use to maximize their influence and returns?

Shareholders can use several advanced strategies to increase their influence and returns. One way is by joining forces with other shareholders to form a group. This group can have more power to push for changes in the company. For example, they might work together to vote for new people on the board of directors who will make decisions that help the company do better. Another strategy is to use shareholder proposals. These are ideas that shareholders can suggest at meetings, like asking the company to be more environmentally friendly or to change how it pays its leaders. If enough shareholders support these proposals, the company might have to listen and make changes.

Another advanced strategy is to use options and other financial tools. Options let shareholders buy or sell shares at a set price in the future. This can help them make money if they think the share price will go up or down. Shareholders can also use short selling, which means borrowing shares to sell them now and buying them back later at a lower price. This can be risky but can lead to big returns if done right. By using these tools, shareholders can try to make more money from their shares and have a bigger say in how the company is run.

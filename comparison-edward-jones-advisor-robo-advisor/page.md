## What is a financial advisor?

A financial advisor is a person who helps you with your money. They give advice on how to save, invest, and plan for the future. They can help you make smart choices about things like buying a house, saving for your kids' college, or planning for retirement.

Financial advisors know a lot about different financial products like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. They use this knowledge to help you reach your money goals. They might work for a bank, an investment firm, or they might have their own business. It's important to choose a financial advisor you trust because they will be helping you make important decisions about your money.

## What is a robo-advisor?

A robo-advisor is a type of financial advisor that uses computer programs to help you with your money. Instead of talking to a person, you use a website or an app. The robo-advisor asks you questions about your money goals and how much risk you want to take. Then, it creates a plan for you and invests your money in things like stocks and bonds.

Robo-advisors are usually cheaper than human financial advisors because they don't have the same costs. They are good for people who want a simple way to invest without spending a lot of time or money. But, they might not be able to give you the personal touch and detailed advice that a human advisor can. So, they are best for people who are okay with a more automated approach to managing their money.

## What services does Edward Jones offer as a financial advisor?

Edward Jones is a financial advisor that helps people with their money. They offer services like investment advice, retirement planning, and saving for big goals like buying a house or paying for college. They work with you to understand what you want to achieve with your money and then create a plan to help you reach those goals. Their advisors meet with you in person or over the phone to make sure they understand your needs and can give you the best advice.

They also help you manage your investments. This means they can buy and sell stocks, bonds, and other investments for you. They keep an eye on how your investments are doing and make changes if needed. Edward Jones also offers tools and resources to help you learn more about money and investing. They want to make sure you feel confident about your financial decisions.

## How do robo-advisors function and what services do they provide?

Robo-advisors work by using computer programs to help you with your money. You go to their website or use their app and answer some questions about your money goals and how much risk you are okay with. After you answer the questions, the robo-advisor makes a plan for you and puts your money into investments like stocks and bonds. It does all this automatically, so you don't need to do much work. The robo-advisor keeps watching your investments and makes changes if needed to keep your plan on track.

The services robo-advisors provide are pretty simple but helpful. They help you invest your money without you having to pick specific stocks or bonds. They do all the choosing for you based on what you told them you want. They also keep your investments balanced, which means they make sure your money is spread out in a way that matches your risk level. Some robo-advisors even let you save for things like retirement or buying a house. They are a good choice if you want an easy and cheap way to start investing.

## What are the fees associated with using Edward Jones as a financial advisor?

When you use Edward Jones as a financial advisor, you will have to pay some fees. They charge a fee for managing your investments, which is usually a percentage of the money you have invested with them. This fee can be around 1% to 1.25% of your total investment each year. They also charge fees when they buy or sell investments for you. These are called transaction fees, and they can be different depending on what kind of investment it is.

Edward Jones might also charge other fees for things like setting up your account or for certain services they offer. It's important to ask them about all the fees so you know exactly what you will be paying. The fees can add up, so make sure you understand them before you start working with Edward Jones.

## What are the typical costs involved in using a robo-advisor?

Using a robo-advisor usually costs less than using a human financial advisor. Most robo-advisors charge a small fee based on how much money you have invested with them. This fee is often around 0.25% to 0.50% of your total investment each year. So, if you have $10,000 invested, you might pay between $25 and $50 a year.

Besides the management fee, there can be other costs. Robo-advisors invest your money in things like stocks and bonds, and these investments can have their own fees. These are called expense ratios, and they are usually very small, often less than 0.10%. So, if you're investing in a fund with a 0.05% expense ratio, for every $10,000 you have invested, you would pay $5 a year in fund fees. Overall, robo-advisors are a cheaper way to get help with your money, but it's good to know all the costs involved.

## How does the investment strategy of Edward Jones differ from that of a robo-advisor?

Edward Jones uses a more personal approach to help you with your money. Their advisors meet with you to understand what you want to achieve, like saving for retirement or buying a home. They then create a plan just for you and pick investments like stocks and bonds that they think will help you reach your goals. They keep an eye on your investments and can make changes if something in your life changes or if the market does something unexpected. Edward Jones charges a fee for this service, which can be around 1% to 1.25% of your total investment each year, plus other fees for buying and selling investments.

On the other hand, a robo-advisor uses a computer program to help you invest. You answer some questions online about your goals and how much risk you're okay with, and the robo-advisor makes a plan for you automatically. It puts your money into investments like stocks and bonds without you having to pick them yourself. Robo-advisors keep your investments balanced and make changes as needed, but it's all done by the computer. The fees for using a robo-advisor are usually much lower, often around 0.25% to 0.50% of your total investment each year, plus small fees for the investments themselves.

The main difference is that Edward Jones offers a more personal touch with human advisors who can give detailed advice and make adjustments based on your specific situation. A robo-advisor, while cheaper and easier to use, doesn't have that personal touch and works more on a set-it-and-forget-it basis. Both can be good options, but it depends on what you're looking for in a financial advisor.

## What level of personalization can clients expect from Edward Jones compared to a robo-advisor?

Clients of Edward Jones can expect a high level of personalization. When you work with Edward Jones, you get a human financial advisor who meets with you to learn about your money goals, like saving for retirement or buying a house. They create a plan just for you and pick investments that fit your needs. If something changes in your life or the market, your advisor can make changes to your plan to keep you on track. This personal touch means you get advice that is tailored to your specific situation, which can be really helpful if you have complicated financial needs.

On the other hand, robo-advisors offer less personalization. When you use a robo-advisor, you answer some questions online about your goals and risk level, and the computer program makes a plan for you. It picks investments automatically based on what you told it, but it doesn't know the details of your life like a human advisor would. While robo-advisors can still help you invest your money, they don't offer the same level of personal advice and adjustments that you get from Edward Jones. They are good for people who want a simple and cheaper way to invest, but if you need more personal attention, Edward Jones might be a better fit.

## How does the performance of investments managed by Edward Jones compare to those managed by robo-advisors?

When you compare the performance of investments managed by Edward Jones to those managed by robo-advisors, it's important to remember that past results don't guarantee future success. Edward Jones uses human advisors who create personalized plans and pick investments based on your goals. They can adjust your plan if things change, which might help your investments do better over time. But, because they charge higher fees, the cost can eat into your returns. So, while Edward Jones might offer better performance for some people because of the personal touch, the higher fees could mean less money in your pocket at the end of the day.

Robo-advisors, on the other hand, use computer programs to manage your money. They pick investments based on your answers to some questions, and they keep your investments balanced without you having to do anything. Because they have lower fees, more of your money stays invested, which can help your investments grow over time. Studies have shown that robo-advisors can do just as well as human advisors for many people, especially if you're okay with a simple, hands-off approach. So, while robo-advisors might not offer the same level of personalization, their lower costs can lead to better overall returns for some investors.

## What kind of client support and communication can one expect from Edward Jones versus a robo-advisor?

When you choose Edward Jones, you get a human financial advisor who will talk to you about your money goals. They will meet with you in person or over the phone to understand what you want to achieve. This means you can ask them questions anytime and get advice that fits your life. If something changes, like you get a new job or want to buy a house, your advisor will be there to help you adjust your plan. Edward Jones wants to make sure you feel supported and confident about your money decisions.

With a robo-advisor, you don't get a human to talk to in the same way. You use a website or an app to set up your investment plan. If you have questions, you might be able to find answers online or through customer support, but it's not as personal. Robo-advisors are good if you want a simple way to invest without a lot of talking. They send you updates on how your investments are doing, but you won't have someone calling you to check in or help you with big decisions.

## How do Edward Jones and robo-advisors handle risk management and portfolio diversification?

Edward Jones uses human advisors to help you manage risk and diversify your portfolio. They talk to you about how much risk you want to take and what you want to achieve with your money. Then, they pick a mix of investments like stocks, bonds, and other things to spread out your risk. If the market changes or something big happens in your life, your advisor can change your investments to keep your plan on track. They want to make sure your money is safe but still growing, so they keep a close eye on everything.

Robo-advisors use computer programs to manage risk and diversify your portfolio. You tell them how much risk you're okay with, and the program picks a mix of investments for you. They use something called modern portfolio theory to spread your money out in a way that matches your risk level. Robo-advisors keep your investments balanced automatically, so if one part of your portfolio grows too big or too small, they fix it without you having to do anything. It's all done by the computer, so it's easy but less personal than working with someone at Edward Jones.

## What are the tax implications and strategies employed by Edward Jones and robo-advisors?

Edward Jones helps you with taxes by talking to you about your money goals and how taxes fit into your plan. They can suggest ways to invest that might help you pay less in taxes, like putting money into retirement accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s. If you make money from your investments, they can also help you decide when to sell them to pay less in taxes. They keep an eye on tax laws and can give you advice on how to use them to your advantage. But, because they are human advisors, they can give you personal advice that fits your life and your tax situation.

Robo-advisors use computer programs to help you with taxes, but it's not as personal as with Edward Jones. They can put your money into tax-friendly accounts like IRAs, and they use something called tax-loss harvesting to help you pay less in taxes. This means if one of your investments loses money, they might sell it to use that loss to lower your taxes. But, because robo-advisors work with everyone the same way, they can't give you advice that's just for you. They follow set rules to help with taxes, but they don't know the details of your life like a human advisor would.

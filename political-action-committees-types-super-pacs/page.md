Political Action Committees (PACs) and Super PACs represent a significant facet of political financing in the United States, profoundly influencing electoral outcomes and policy directions. PACs, organizations formed to pool campaign contributions from members and donate those funds to campaign for or against candidates, ballot initiatives, or legislation, have long been instrumental in shaping the political landscape. Super PACs, formally known as "independent expenditure-only committees," differ from traditional PACs in their allowance for unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, and unions as a result of the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. FEC. This decision effectively transformed how political campaigns are funded, enabling Super PACs to raise and spend unlimited sums, albeit without direct coordination with candidates or parties.

Parallelly, algorithmic trading has emerged as a cornerstone of modern financial markets, utilizing advanced mathematical models and algorithms to execute trades at speeds and frequencies far beyond human capability. Financial institutions leverage these algorithms to identify trading opportunities, optimize portfolio management, and execute high-frequency trades, resulting in enhanced market liquidity, reduced trading costs, and increased market efficiency. With the proliferation of data and advancement in computational power, algorithmic trading now accounts for a substantial fraction of trading volumes in equity markets worldwide.

## Understanding Political Action Committees (PACs) and Super PACs

Political Action Committees, commonly known as PACs, are entities established to raise and spend money to elect or defeat political candidates. A PAC's primary objective is to collect political donations from members and allocate those funds towards campaign activities for or against candidates, ballot initiatives, or legislation. Traditional PACs operate under strict regulatory guidelines that cap direct contributions to federal candidates to $5,000 per election and limit financial gifts from individuals to $5,000 annually. These financial restrictions aim to mitigate excessive influence on candidates stemming from large financial contributions [Federal Election Commission, 2023].

In contrast, Super PACs, officially termed as "independent expenditure-only committees," emerged in the political landscape following the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision in 2010. This landmark ruling dismantled the constraints that prohibited corporations and unions from utilizing treasury funds for political advertising. Consequently, Super PACs can raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations, and individuals. Unlike traditional PACs, they are not subject to spending limits. However, Super PACs are prohibited from directly funneling money to political candidates or parties, instead focusing solely on independent expenditures like advertisements advocating for the election or defeat of specific candidates [Federal Election Commission, 2023].

The legal framework governing PACs and Super PACs includes various federal laws and regulations designed to ensure transparency and accountability. Both entities must register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and report their contributions and expenditures periodically. While traditional PACs have explicit contribution caps, Super PACs can raise and spend unlimited funds but must disclose donor identities if contributions exceed $200 in a calendar year. These reporting requirements serve to inform the public about the financial backers of political campaigns, although concerns about transparency persist as funders may opt to route money through intermediary organizations to obscure its origin [Center for Responsive Politics, 2023].

Super PACs have significantly evolved the political fundraising landscape, wielding substantial influence in recent electoral cycles. Post-Citizens United, major Super PACs have amassed significant power by channeling enormous financial resources into campaigns. For instance, in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, Super PACs spent over $600 million, reflecting their capacity to shape campaign narratives and, potentially, election outcomes [OpenSecrets, 2023]. The 2016 and 2020 presidential elections further illustrated the impact of Super PACs, with entities like Priorities USA Action and American Crossroads playing pivotal roles in advertising and strategic campaign support.

These case studies underscore the pivotal role Super PACs play in modern U.S. politics, raising questions about their influence on democratic processes and equity in political competition. As the political and regulatory landscapes continue to evolve, balancing robust electoral finance regulations with the freedom of political expression and engagement remains a crucial challenge for lawmakers and electoral bodies.

# Sample data: features (X) and target variable (y)
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # Random features
y = np.random.rand(100)     # Random target variable

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Instantiate and train the neural network
model = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(50,), max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate

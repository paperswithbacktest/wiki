## What are the reporting requirements for institutions following the Japan Stewardship Code?

Institutions that follow the Japan Stewardship Code need to tell everyone how they are doing it. They have to write a report every year. In this report, they explain how they talk to the companies they invest in, how they vote at shareholder meetings, and how they make their investment decisions. This report should be easy to find on their website or in their official documents. By sharing this information, they show that they are being open and honest about their work.

The report should also talk about any problems they faced and what they did to fix them. It's important for the institutions to show that they are always trying to get better at following the code. This helps everyone trust them more and understand how they are helping the companies they invest in to improve. By being clear about their actions, they can show that they are responsible investors who care about making the economy stronger.

## How is compliance with the Japan Stewardship Code monitored and enforced?

Compliance with the Japan Stewardship Code is monitored mainly through the reports that institutions have to write every year. These reports show how well the institutions are following the code's principles. They need to explain how they talk to the companies they invest in, how they vote at shareholder meetings, and how they make their investment decisions. The reports are shared publicly, so everyone can see them. This helps keep the institutions honest and makes sure they are doing what they said they would do.

There isn't a strict enforcement system for the Japan Stewardship Code. Instead, it relies on the institutions wanting to do the right thing and be seen as responsible investors. If an institution doesn't follow the code well, it might get a bad reputation. This can make other people less likely to invest with them. So, even though there are no big punishments, the pressure to keep a good name helps make sure institutions follow the code.

## What are some challenges and criticisms of the Japan Stewardship Code?

One challenge of the Japan Stewardship Code is that it relies a lot on institutions wanting to follow it on their own. There are no strict rules or punishments if they don't follow the code. This means some institutions might not take it seriously. They might say they are following the code, but not really do what it says. This can make it hard to know if everyone is really doing their best to help the companies they invest in.

Another criticism is that the code might not be strong enough to make big changes. Some people think it needs more rules to make sure everyone follows it the same way. They worry that without clear rules, some investors might not help companies improve as much as they could. Also, it can be hard for small investors to have a big impact on big companies. They might not have enough power to make a difference, even if they follow the code.

## How does the Japan Stewardship Code compare to similar codes in other countries?

The Japan Stewardship Code is similar to codes in other countries like the UK Stewardship Code and the US's principles for responsible investment. All these codes want investors to be responsible and help the companies they invest in to do better. They all say that investors should talk to the companies, vote at meetings, and be open about what they do. But each country's code is a bit different because they have different rules and ways of doing things.

For example, the UK Stewardship Code has more strict rules and checks to make sure investors follow it. They have a system to see if investors are doing what they say they will do. The Japan Stewardship Code doesn't have this kind of strict checking. It relies more on investors wanting to do the right thing. Also, the US has different groups that help investors follow their principles, while in Japan, it's mostly up to the investors themselves to make sure they follow the code.

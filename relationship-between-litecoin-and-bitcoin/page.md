```python
def moving_average(prices, period):
    return sum(prices[-period:]) / period

def check_signal(prices, short_term=50, long_term=200):
    short_ma = moving_average(prices, short_term)
    long_ma = moving_average(prices, long_term)
    if short_ma > long_ma:
        return "Buy"
    elif short_ma < long_ma:
        return "Sell"
    else:
        return "Hold"
```

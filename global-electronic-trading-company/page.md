## The Founding of GETCO

GETCO was born from the insight and expertise of Stephen Schuler and Dan Tierney, two former floor traders with a keen understanding of the trading landscape. They recognized the transformative potential of electronic trading at a time when the financial industry was only beginning to embrace digital innovations. This foresight led to the establishment of GETCO in Chicago in 1999, a city renowned for its deep-rooted trading history and a thriving community of financial professionals.

Chicago provided an ideal environment for the nascent firm due to its vibrant trading culture and the presence of major exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The city's prominence as a global trading hub offered GETCO access to a pool of talented individuals and cutting-edge technological infrastructure, essential for the firm's ambition to excel in the electronic trading sphere.

From its inception, GETCO emphasized the utilization of computational power to enhance trading efficiency. The firm tapped into high-frequency trading ([HFT](/wiki/high-frequency-trading-strategies)), which involves executing a large number of trades at incredible speeds, often within microseconds. This approach allowed GETCO to capitalize on minute price discrepancies across different markets, optimizing trade execution and profitability.

To achieve this, GETCO invested heavily in technology and infrastructure, deploying state-of-the-art hardware and developing proprietary algorithms capable of processing vast amounts of market data in real-time. The firm's commitment to technological advancement positioned it at the cutting edge of high-frequency trading, allowing it to rapidly scale its operations and solidify its status as a leader in the industry.

The strategic focus on electronic and [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) enabled GETCO to offer superior [liquidity](/wiki/liquidity-risk-premium) and tighter bid-ask spreads on electronic exchanges. This not only attracted a wide range of trading partners but also benefited the broader financial market ecosystem by enhancing overall market efficiency and price discovery. Through these efforts, GETCO set the foundation for a successful trajectory in the rapidly evolving world of electronic trading.

## GETCO's Contributions to Algorithmic Trading

GETCO has been a leading force in the development and implementation of algorithmic trading systems. These systems are designed to execute trades with superior speed and precision, utilizing sophisticated algorithms that analyze market data and identify optimal trading opportunities. By employing such advanced technology, GETCO has facilitated trading on over 50 major electronic exchanges globally, thereby showcasing its extensive operational reach and technological expertise.

The firm's algorithms are capable of handling a wide variety of asset classes, allowing them to make split-second trading decisions that are crucial in high-frequency trading (HFT). This capability is backed by powerful computational resources that process massive volumes of financial data, enabling GETCO to stay competitive in the fast-paced environment of electronic trading.

One of the significant contributions of GETCO's algorithmic trading is the improvement of market liquidity. By enabling trades to occur swiftly and efficiently, GETCO helps maintain an active market where buy and sell orders are readily matched. This contribution is vital as liquidity is a key determinant of a market's efficiency and stability. Greater market liquidity results in tighter bid-ask spreads, which in turn lowers the cost of trading for market participants.

Additionally, GETCO's algorithms enhance price discovery, which is the process of determining the fair price of an asset through the interaction of buyers and sellers. By facilitating rapid and continuous trading, these algorithms ensure that prices reflect the most current market information. This accuracy in price discovery benefits both individual investors, who seek fair prices for their trades, and institutional investors, who require reliable data to make large financial decisions.

GETCOâ€™s emphasis on innovation extends to developing new trading strategies and technologies that address evolving market conditions. This commitment to progress ensures that its trading practices remain at the cutting edge, continuously refining the efficacy of algorithmic trading and deepening the influence on global financial markets.

In summary, GETCO has significantly advanced algorithmic trading, distinguished by its technological advancements and innovative trading practices. By improving market liquidity and enhancing price discovery, the firm has not only benefitted its clients but also contributed positively to the overall efficiency and transparency of financial markets.

## The Merger with Knight Capital Group

In December 2012, GETCO announced a significant acquisition of Knight Capital Group, marking a strategic expansion of GETCO's influence in the financial markets. This merger, valued at approximately $1.4 billion, was concluded in July 2013 with the formation of KCG Holdings. The decision to merge with Knight Capital Group was driven by the complementary strengths of both entities in electronic trading and market-making.

Knight Capital Group, prior to the merger, was a well-established player in the financial services industry, specializing in market-making, electronic and voice trading across multiple asset classes. The merger allowed GETCO to leverage Knight's extensive market presence and customer relationships, integrating them with GETCO's advanced algorithmic trading capabilities and technological infrastructure. This combination enhanced the overall market-making and trading functions, providing increased liquidity and pricing efficiency in the markets.

The merger was not only a consolidation of resources but also an amalgamation of strategies aimed at optimizing trading processes and increasing revenue streams. By aligning their operations and technologies, KCG Holdings positioned itself as a formidable entity in the financial services sector, catering to a broad spectrum of clients, from retail traders to large institutional investors. The collaboration enhanced KCG's ability to deliver superior trading solutions and reinforced its role in shaping the future of electronic trading.

## GETCO's Market Impact and Legacy

GETCO's algorithms and trading strategies profoundly impacted global electronic trading, fundamentally transforming how markets operate. By utilizing advanced algorithms, GETCO significantly improved liquidity and price discovery processes, benefiting both individual and institutional investors. The firm's technology-driven approach enabled rapid trade execution across multiple asset classes on more than 50 major electronic exchanges worldwide. This expansive reach and technological innovation facilitated a level of market efficiency and depth previously unattainable in traditional trading frameworks.

Through its partnerships with exchanges and regulators, GETCO played a crucial role in advancing market transparency and efficiency. The firm addressed concerns commonly associated with high-frequency trading (HFT) by implementing practices that mitigated potential market disruptions and improved trade execution reliability. For instance, GETCO's collaboration with regulators aided in developing policies that balanced the speed and efficiency of HFT with the need for market stability. This collaboration was instrumental in establishing mechanisms such as trading halts and [volatility](/wiki/volatility-trading-strategies) controls, which protect markets from erratic price swings often associated with algorithmic trading.

Despite the retirement of the GETCO name following its merger with Knight Capital Group (forming KCG Holdings), its influence is evident in KCG's continued operations and successes. The merger allowed the combined entity to leverage GETCO's sophisticated trading algorithms and Knight's established market presence, creating a powerhouse in financial services. KCG Holdings continued to embody GETCO's commitment to innovation and efficiency, applying cutting-edge technology to enhance market functionality and serve a diverse client base. This legacy underscores GETCO's lasting impact on electronic trading, as the principles and technologies it pioneered remain integral to the financial industry's evolution.

## Conclusion

As a pioneer of electronic and algorithmic trading, GETCO has significantly influenced the financial markets by embracing innovation and technological advancements. The firm's strategic growth trajectory was highlighted by its merger with Knight Capital, a move that not only expanded its market capabilities and influence but also cemented its authority in the financial services industry. This merger, valued at $1.4 billion, resulted in the formation of KCG Holdings, integrating Knight Capital's complementary strengths with GETCO's high-frequency trading expertise.

GETCO's legacy is evident in its enduring contribution to the evolution of trading systems, with its sophisticated algorithms and technological solutions continuing to enhance market efficiency and transparency. These advancements have fundamentally improved liquidity and price discovery, offering substantial benefits to both individual and institutional investors alike. Even after the retirement of the GETCO brand, its innovative approaches and strategic methodologies remain embedded in today's trading practices, underscoring a lasting influence that extends beyond its original operations. Whether through enhanced algorithmic frameworks, collaborations with exchanges, or regulatory partnerships, GETCO has facilitated a modern trading environment that adapts to and anticipates the dynamic demands of global financial markets.

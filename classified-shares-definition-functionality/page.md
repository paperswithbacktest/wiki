## What are classified shares?

Classified shares, also known as dual-class or multi-class shares, are a type of stock structure where a company issues different classes of stock, each with different voting rights and dividend policies. This means that some shareholders might have more power in making decisions for the company because their shares come with more votes per share than others. For example, one class of shares might have 10 votes per share, while another class might have just one vote per share.

Companies use classified shares for various reasons. Often, founders or key executives want to keep control over the company even after it goes public or raises more capital. By holding onto shares with more voting power, they can make important decisions without needing approval from all shareholders. However, this structure can be controversial because it might not treat all investors equally, leading to debates about fairness and corporate governance.

## How do classified shares differ from common shares?

Classified shares and common shares are different because classified shares come in different types, and each type can have different voting rights and dividend payments. Common shares usually have one vote per share and equal rights to dividends. With classified shares, a company might have Class A shares with more votes per share and Class B shares with fewer votes or no votes at all. This means that people who own Class A shares might have more say in how the company is run.

Companies use classified shares to let founders or key people keep control of the company, even if they own less of it. For example, a founder might keep Class A shares with 10 votes each, while selling Class B shares with 1 vote each to the public. This way, the founder can still make big decisions for the company. On the other hand, common shares treat all shareholders the same, giving everyone an equal say and an equal part of the profits. This can be fairer, but it might make it harder for the original owners to keep control as the company grows.

## What are the main types of classified shares?

Classified shares can be divided into different types, like Class A, Class B, and sometimes even Class C shares. Each type can have different voting rights and dividend payments. Class A shares usually have more votes per share. For example, one Class A share might give you 10 votes. Class B shares often have fewer votes, maybe just one vote per share. Class C shares might have no voting rights at all but could offer other benefits, like higher dividends.

Companies use these different types of shares to let founders or key people keep control of the company. If a founder keeps Class A shares, they can still make big decisions even if they own less of the company. This is because their shares have more votes. On the other hand, Class B and Class C shares might be sold to the public. People who buy these shares help the company raise money, but they have less say in how the company is run. This can be good for the founders but might not seem fair to all investors.

## What are the benefits of issuing classified shares for a company?

Issuing classified shares can help a company keep control in the hands of its founders or key executives. When a company goes public or raises more money, it might sell shares to new investors. If these shares all had the same voting power, the original owners could lose control. But with classified shares, the founders can keep shares with more votes, like Class A shares. This means they can still make big decisions for the company, even if they own less of it. This can be really important for people who started the company and want to keep guiding it in the direction they think is best.

Another benefit is that classified shares can make it easier for a company to raise money. By offering different types of shares, a company can attract different kinds of investors. Some investors might want shares with voting power, while others might be happy with shares that offer higher dividends but no votes. This flexibility can help the company get the money it needs to grow without giving up too much control. It's a way for the company to balance the need for new capital with the desire to stay in charge of its own future.

## How do classified shares affect voting rights?

Classified shares can change how voting works in a company. When a company has different types of shares, like Class A and Class B, each type can have different voting rights. For example, one Class A share might give you 10 votes, while one Class B share might give you just one vote. This means that people who own Class A shares have more say in how the company is run. They can make big decisions without needing as many votes from Class B shareholders.

This setup helps founders or key people keep control of the company. Even if they own less of the company, they can still have a lot of power because their shares have more votes. This can be good for them, but it might not seem fair to other investors who own shares with fewer votes. It's a way for the company to balance keeping control with raising money from new investors.

## What are the potential risks or drawbacks of classified shares for investors?

Classified shares can be risky for investors because they might not have much say in how the company is run. If you own shares with fewer votes or no votes at all, like Class B or Class C shares, you can't help make big decisions. This means the founders or key people who own shares with more votes can do what they want, even if other investors disagree. This can feel unfair and might make investors worried about how the company is being managed.

Another drawback is that classified shares can make it harder to hold the company's leaders accountable. If the founders have most of the voting power, they might not listen to what other shareholders think. This can lead to problems if the company isn't doing well, because it's harder for investors to make changes. Some investors might decide not to buy shares in a company with classified shares because they want to have a say in how the company is run and be treated fairly.

## Can you explain the process of issuing classified shares?

When a company decides to issue classified shares, it starts by planning out the different types of shares it wants to offer. This might include Class A shares with more votes per share, Class B shares with fewer votes, and maybe even Class C shares with no voting rights but possibly higher dividends. The company's board of directors and legal team work together to set up the rules for each type of share. They need to decide how many votes each share gets and any other special rights or benefits. Once they have a plan, they write it down in the company's legal documents, like the articles of incorporation or bylaws.

After setting up the rules, the company needs to get approval from its current shareholders and any needed regulatory bodies. They might hold a shareholder meeting to vote on the new share structure. If the shareholders agree, the company can then move forward with issuing the classified shares. They usually do this through an initial public offering (IPO) or a secondary offering, where they offer the new shares to the public or existing investors. The company makes sure to explain the different types of shares clearly in the offering documents, so investors know what they're buying. This way, the company can raise money while keeping control in the hands of its founders or key people.

## How do classified shares impact a company's capital structure?

Classified shares can change a company's capital structure by creating different types of stock, each with its own set of rights and benefits. When a company issues classified shares, it might have Class A shares with more votes per share, Class B shares with fewer votes, and maybe even Class C shares with no votes but possibly higher dividends. This setup allows the company to raise money from investors while keeping control in the hands of founders or key executives. By offering different types of shares, the company can attract a wider range of investors, some who want voting power and others who are more interested in dividends.

This approach to capital structure can make the company more flexible but also more complex. It helps the company balance the need for new capital with the desire to maintain control. However, it can also create tension among shareholders, especially if those with fewer votes feel they are not being treated fairly. Overall, classified shares can be a powerful tool for managing a company's growth and governance, but they require careful planning and clear communication to work well.

## What are some real-world examples of companies using classified shares?

One famous example of a company using classified shares is Google, now part of Alphabet Inc. When Google went public in 2004, it issued three types of shares: Class A, Class B, and Class C. Class A shares, which are traded publicly, have one vote per share. Class B shares, mostly owned by founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, have ten votes each. This lets them keep a lot of control over the company. Class C shares, introduced later, have no voting rights at all. This setup helps Google raise money while letting its founders guide the company's future.

Another example is Facebook, now Meta Platforms. When Facebook went public in 2012, it also used a dual-class share structure. The company issued Class A shares with one vote each, which are available to the public, and Class B shares with ten votes each, mostly held by founder Mark Zuckerberg and other early investors. This way, Zuckerberg can make big decisions for the company even as it grows and brings in new investors. This structure has helped him keep control while still raising money to expand the business.

## How do regulatory bodies view the use of classified shares?

Regulatory bodies around the world have different views on classified shares. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allows companies to use classified shares, but they have to be clear about the different types of shares and their voting rights. The SEC wants to make sure that investors know what they are buying and can make good choices. Some people worry that classified shares might not be fair to all investors, so the SEC keeps a close eye on how companies use them.

In other places, like Europe, the rules can be stricter. Some countries, like the UK, have rules that make it harder for companies to use classified shares because they want to protect investors and make sure everyone has an equal say. These rules can make it tough for companies that want to keep control while raising money. Overall, regulatory bodies want to balance the need for companies to grow with the need to treat all investors fairly.

## What are the tax implications of classified shares for both the company and the shareholders?

For a company, the tax implications of issuing classified shares are generally the same as issuing common shares. The company does not face different tax treatments just because it has different classes of stock. However, the way the company structures its dividends might change. If the company decides to pay higher dividends to certain classes of shares, like Class C shares, it might affect the overall tax situation. But the main tax events for the company, like corporate income tax, remain the same regardless of the share classification.

For shareholders, the tax implications can vary depending on the type of classified shares they own. If they receive dividends, these are usually taxed as income. The amount of dividends and the type of shares can affect how much tax a shareholder pays. For example, if Class C shares offer higher dividends, shareholders might pay more in taxes on those dividends. Also, when shareholders sell their shares, they might have to pay capital gains tax. The tax rate could depend on how long they held the shares and how much profit they made. It's important for shareholders to understand the tax rules in their country because they can be different everywhere.

## How do classified shares influence corporate governance and control?

Classified shares can change how a company is run by giving different voting powers to different types of shares. If a company has Class A shares with more votes and Class B shares with fewer votes, the people who own Class A shares can make big decisions without needing as many votes from Class B shareholders. This setup helps founders or key people keep control of the company, even if they own less of it. For example, founders might keep Class A shares with 10 votes each, while selling Class B shares with 1 vote each to the public. This way, they can still guide the company's future without losing power.

This can be good for founders who want to keep control, but it might not seem fair to other investors. Those who own shares with fewer votes might feel they don't have a say in how the company is run. It can also make it harder for investors to hold the company's leaders accountable if things aren't going well. Some investors might not want to buy shares in a company with classified shares because they want to be treated equally and have a voice in the company's decisions. Overall, classified shares can help a company balance raising money with keeping control, but they need to be used carefully to keep everyone happy.

# Load the financial dataset
data = pd.read_csv('financial_data.csv')
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the Random Forest model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions and evaluation
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

This code snippet serves to exemplify how a data-driven approach is structured, providing a foundation upon which more sophisticated and tailored models can be constructed to cater to specific trading strategies that emphasize cash flow management.

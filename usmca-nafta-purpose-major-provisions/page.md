## USMCA vs. NAFTA: Key Differences

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) represents a significant update to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which had governed trade relations among the three countries since 1994. One of the primary motivations for transitioning from NAFTA to the USMCA was to modernize the trade framework to reflect the substantial economic, technological, and social changes that had occurred over the intervening decades.

### Automotive Sector

One of the most notable changes between NAFTA and the USMCA pertains to the automotive industry. Under NAFTA, the rules of origin required that 62.5% of vehicle content must be sourced from North America to qualify for tariff-free access. The USMCA raises this threshold to 75%, encouraging more regional production. Additionally, 70% of a vehicle's steel and aluminum must originate in North America. Moreover, the USMCA introduces labor value content provisions, requiring that 40-45% of automobile content be made by workers [earning](/wiki/earning-announcement) at least $16 per hour, aimed at boosting wages within the industry.

### Dairy Sector

The dairy sector saw significant changes under the USMCA. Canada agreed to eliminate its Class 7 pricing system, which had been a point of contention under NAFTA, as it limited market access for U.S. dairy producers by creating lower prices for specific dairy products. The USMCA provides the U.S. with expanded access to the Canadian dairy market, allowing American producers to supply an additional 3.6% of the Canadian market, enhancing opportunities for U.S. dairy exports.

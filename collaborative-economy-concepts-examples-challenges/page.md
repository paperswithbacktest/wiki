The Python code snippet below demonstrates a simple implementation of sentiment analysis using the `TextBlob` library:

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    analysis = TextBlob(text)
    if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0:
        return "Positive"
    elif analysis.sentiment.polarity < 0:
        return "Negative"
    else:
        return "Neutral"

news = "The stock market is showing positive trends today."
print(analyze_sentiment(news))  # Output: Positive
```

Integrating algorithmic trading into collaborative economies offers numerous opportunities for innovation, such as improved resource allocation and enhanced market access for individual traders. However, it also presents challenges.

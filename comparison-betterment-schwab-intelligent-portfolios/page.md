## What are Betterment and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios?

Betterment and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios are both robo-advisors, which means they are online services that use computer algorithms to manage your investments. Betterment was one of the first robo-advisors and it helps you invest your money in a way that matches your goals and how much risk you are willing to take. They offer different types of accounts like individual, joint, and retirement accounts. Betterment also gives you advice on how to save for things like buying a house or going to college.

Schwab Intelligent Portfolios is a robo-advisor from Charles Schwab, a big financial company. Like Betterment, it uses technology to create and manage a portfolio for you based on your goals and risk tolerance. One big difference is that Schwab Intelligent Portfolios does not charge any advisory fees, but you need to keep at least $5,000 in your account. They also offer different types of accounts and can help you with planning for retirement or other financial goals.

Both services are easy to use and can be a good choice if you want to invest your money but don't want to spend a lot of time managing it yourself. They take care of the hard work of choosing and adjusting your investments to help you reach your financial goals.

## How do Betterment and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios differ in terms of fees?

Betterment charges a fee for managing your money. For their basic plan, called Betterment Digital, you pay 0.25% of the money you have invested each year. If you want more help and advice, you can choose Betterment Premium, which costs 0.40% per year, but you need to have at least $100,000 invested. On top of these fees, there are also costs for the ETFs (exchange-traded funds) that Betterment invests your money in, which are usually around 0.07% to 0.15% per year.

Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, on the other hand, does not charge any advisory fees. This means you don't pay them to manage your money. However, you need to keep at least $5,000 in your account to use their service. Like Betterment, Schwab also invests your money in ETFs, and these ETFs have their own fees, which are about 0.02% to 0.16% per year. So, while you don't pay Schwab directly for managing your money, you still pay the costs of the ETFs they choose for your portfolio.

## What types of investment accounts can be opened with Betterment and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios?

With Betterment, you can open several types of accounts to help you reach your financial goals.

Betterment also has retirement accounts like Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and SEP IRAs, which are great for saving for your future. If you're saving for your kids' education, you can open a 529 account with Betterment too. They even have trust accounts if you need to manage money for someone else.

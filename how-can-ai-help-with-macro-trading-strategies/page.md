import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM

# Load and preprocess data
data = pd.read_csv('stock_prices.csv')
data = data[['Close']]  # Select only the closing prices
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0,1))
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data.values)

# Prepare training and testing datasets
train_data, test_data = train_test_split(scaled_data, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)

# Build the LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(train_data.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(LSTM(units=50))
model.add(Dense(units=1))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(train_data, epochs=50, batch_size=32)

# Predict and evaluate
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
predictions = scaler.inverse_transform(predictions)
```

This example demonstrates how AI tools can be employed for financial predictions, offering invaluable assistance to global macro strategists by facilitating real-time data analysis and decision-making.

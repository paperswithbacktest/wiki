# Calculate moving averages as a simple trading indicator
data['SMA_20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Identify trading signals
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['SMA_20'] > data['SMA_50']) & (data['SMA_20'].shift(1) <= data['SMA_50'].shift(1))
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['SMA_20'] < data['SMA_50']) & (data['SMA_20'].shift(1) >= data['SMA_50'].shift(1))

# Display signals
print(data[['Date', 'Buy_Signal', 'Sell_Signal']].dropna())
```

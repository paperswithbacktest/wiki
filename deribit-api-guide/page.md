    data = json.loads(message)
    price = data['result']['last_price']

    # Example of a simplistic trend-following logic
    if price > moving_average:  # Define moving_average elsewhere
        place_buy_order()       # Define function to place trade
    elif price < moving_average:
        place_sell_order()      # Define function to place trade

def on_error(ws, error):
    print(f"Error: {error}")

def on_close(ws):
    print("Connection closed")

def on_open(ws):
    # Subscribe to the price index
    subscribe_message = {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "public/subscribe",
        "params": {
            "channels": ["ticker.BTC-PERP.100ms"]
        },
        "id": 42
    }
    ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message))

# Define WebSocket connection
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp("wss://www.deribit.com/ws/api/v2",
                            on_open=on_open,
                            on_message=on_message,
                            on_error=on_error,
                            on_close=on_close)

ws.run_forever()

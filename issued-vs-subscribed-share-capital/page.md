## What is share capital?

Share capital is the money a company raises by selling shares to investors. When a company decides to start or grow, it can sell pieces of ownership, called shares, to people or other companies. These shares represent a part of the company, and the total value of these shares is called the share capital. This money helps the company to buy things it needs, like equipment or buildings, or to pay for other costs.

The amount of share capital can change over time. If a company wants more money, it can issue more shares. This means it sells more pieces of ownership to new or existing investors. On the other hand, if a company buys back its own shares, the share capital can go down. Share capital is important because it shows how much money a company has raised from selling its shares, and it can affect how the company is valued and how it operates.

## What is issued share capital?

Issued share capital is the total value of shares that a company has sold to investors. When a company wants to raise money, it can create shares and offer them to people or other companies. The money it gets from selling these shares is called the issued share capital. This is different from the total number of shares a company could create, which is called the authorized share capital. Issued share capital only includes the shares that have actually been sold.

This amount can change over time. If a company decides to sell more shares, the issued share capital will go up because more money comes in from new investors. On the other hand, if the company buys back some of its own shares, the issued share capital will go down. Knowing the issued share capital is important because it shows how much money the company has raised from its shareholders and can affect how the company is run and valued.

## What is subscribed share capital?

Subscribed share capital is the amount of money that people or companies have agreed to pay for shares but haven't paid yet. When a company offers shares, some investors might say they want to buy them but don't give the money right away. The total value of these promised payments is the subscribed share capital.

This is different from issued share capital, which is the money the company has already received from selling shares. Subscribed share capital is important because it shows how much money the company can expect to get in the future. It helps the company plan its finances, knowing that this money will come in soon.

## How does issued share capital differ from subscribed share capital?

Issued share capital is the total amount of money a company has already received from selling its shares to investors. When a company sells shares, the money it gets right away is called the issued share capital. This is the actual money the company has in its bank account from selling shares.

Subscribed share capital, on the other hand, is the total amount of money that investors have promised to pay for shares but haven't paid yet. When investors say they want to buy shares but don't give the money immediately, this promised amount is the subscribed share capital. It's like a promise to pay in the future, and it helps the company know how much money it can expect to get later.

## Why is it important for a company to issue shares?

Issuing shares is important for a company because it helps them raise money. When a company wants to start up, grow, or do new projects, it needs money. By selling shares, the company can get this money from investors who believe in the company's future. This money can be used to buy new equipment, build new factories, hire more workers, or pay for other important costs.

Also, issuing shares can help a company spread out its ownership. Instead of one person or a small group owning everything, many people can own a part of the company. This can make the company stronger and more stable because it has a lot of people supporting it. It also lets the company share the risks and rewards of business with a bigger group of people.

## What are the steps involved in issuing shares?

When a company wants to issue shares, the first step is to decide how many shares to create and how much each share will cost. This is called setting the share price. The company then needs to get approval from its board of directors and sometimes from its existing shareholders. After getting approval, the company can start selling the shares. It can do this by offering them to the public through a stock exchange, or it can sell them directly to specific investors in a private placement.

Once the shares are sold, the company needs to keep track of who owns them. This is done through a share register, which lists all the shareholders and how many shares they own. The company also has to follow rules set by the government and stock exchanges about how it issues and reports on its shares. This includes making sure all shareholders get the information they need about the company's performance and any big changes.

Issuing shares can take some time and involves a lot of paperwork and legal steps. The company may need to hire lawyers and other experts to help with the process. After the shares are issued, the company gets the money from the investors and can use it to grow the business. The investors, in turn, become part-owners of the company and can benefit if the company does well.

## How does a company record issued and subscribed share capital in its financial statements?

A company records issued share capital in its financial statements under the equity section of the balance sheet. This is the total amount of money the company has received from selling its shares to investors. For example, if a company sells 1,000 shares at $10 each, the issued share capital would be $10,000. This amount shows how much money the company has raised by selling shares and is an important part of the company's total equity.

Subscribed share capital is also recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet, but it is shown separately from the issued share capital. This is the total amount of money that investors have promised to pay for shares but haven't paid yet. If investors agree to buy 500 shares at $10 each but haven't paid, the subscribed share capital would be $5,000. This amount helps the company know how much money it can expect to receive in the future, and it's important for planning and understanding the company's financial health.

## What are the legal requirements for issuing and subscribing to shares?

When a company wants to issue shares, it has to follow some rules set by the government and any stock exchange it wants to use. The company needs to get approval from its board of directors and sometimes from its existing shareholders. It also has to create a document called a prospectus, which tells people about the company and the shares it's selling. This document has to be honest and clear so that people can make good choices about buying the shares. If the company is selling shares to the public, it has to register with a government agency like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States. This helps make sure the company follows all the rules and treats investors fairly.

When people or companies want to subscribe to shares, they have to agree to buy them and usually pay some money upfront. The company keeps track of who has subscribed to shares in a share register. This helps the company know who owns what and make sure everyone gets the information they need about the company. Investors who subscribe to shares have to follow the rules set out in the company's articles of association and any agreements they made when they subscribed. This includes paying the rest of the money they owe for the shares on time and following any other rules the company has about owning shares.

## Can issued share capital be more than subscribed share capital? Why or why not?

Issued share capital cannot be more than subscribed share capital. This is because issued share capital is the money a company has already received from selling shares, while subscribed share capital is the total money investors have promised to pay for shares. If investors have promised to buy shares but haven't paid yet, that amount is the subscribed share capital. Once they pay, it becomes part of the issued share capital. So, the issued share capital can only be the same or less than the subscribed share capital, never more.

For example, if a company sells 1,000 shares at $10 each, and investors agree to buy all 1,000 shares but only pay for 800 of them right away, the subscribed share capital would be $10,000 (1,000 shares x $10), and the issued share capital would be $8,000 (800 shares x $10). The company can't have more issued share capital than subscribed because it can't get more money from shares than what investors have promised to pay.

## How do changes in issued and subscribed share capital affect a company's valuation?

When a company issues more shares and gets more money, its issued share capital goes up. This can make the company's value go up because it has more money to use for growing the business, buying new things, or paying off debts. More money can help the company do better, which can make its stock price go up. But if the company issues too many shares, it can also make each share worth less because the ownership of the company is spread out among more people. This can make the company's value go down if investors think the shares are worth less.

Changes in subscribed share capital can also affect a company's valuation, but in a different way. If more people promise to buy shares but haven't paid yet, the subscribed share capital goes up. This shows that investors believe in the company's future and are willing to invest in it. This can make the company's value go up because it shows there is demand for its shares. But, if investors don't pay for the shares they promised to buy, the company might not get the money it was expecting. This can make the company's value go down because it might not have enough money to do what it planned.

## What are the implications of over-subscription and under-subscription of shares?

When a company offers shares and more people want to buy them than there are shares available, it's called over-subscription. This is good for the company because it shows that a lot of people believe in it and want to invest. The company can use this interest to raise more money if it decides to issue more shares. But, it also means some people who wanted to buy shares might not get them, which could make them unhappy. The company needs to decide how to give out the shares fairly, like by lottery or giving priority to certain investors.

On the other hand, under-subscription happens when fewer people want to buy the shares than the company hoped. This can be bad for the company because it might not get all the money it needs. If the company can't sell all the shares, it might have to find other ways to get money, like borrowing or cutting back on plans. Under-subscription can also make people think the company isn't doing well or that its shares aren't worth much, which can hurt its reputation and make it harder to raise money in the future.

## How do different types of shares (e.g., common vs. preferred) impact the structure of issued and subscribed share capital?

When a company issues shares, it can offer different types like common shares and preferred shares. Common shares usually give shareholders voting rights and a chance to get some of the company's profits if it does well. If the company issues more common shares, the issued share capital goes up because it gets more money. The subscribed share capital for common shares is the money people promise to pay for them but haven't yet. More common shares can mean more people own part of the company, which can change how decisions are made because more people get to vote.

Preferred shares are different because they often give shareholders a fixed payment, like a dividend, before common shareholders get anything. They might not have voting rights, so issuing more preferred shares doesn't change how decisions are made as much as common shares do. When a company issues preferred shares, the issued share capital still goes up with the money it gets, and the subscribed share capital is the money people promise to pay for these shares but haven't yet. The mix of common and preferred shares can change how the company's money is shared among shareholders and how much control different people have over the company.

## What is Exploring Subscribed Share Capital?

Subscribed share capital pertains to the shares that investors agree to purchase, though full payment may not yet be completed. This form of capital is particularly significant during Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), where investors express their intent to buy shares before the shares are officially issued. During an IPO, a company offers its shares to the public for the first time, and investors have the opportunity to subscribe to these shares, thereby indicating their interest and commitment.

The subscribed share capital represents a promise from investors that they will contribute a specific amount of capital to the company. This is crucial for companies as it provides an estimate of the funds they can expect to raise, assisting them in financial planning and strategizing for future growth. The process involves a subscription agreement, a key document that outlines the terms and conditions under which the shares will be purchased.

Subscription agreements serve as legally binding contracts between the issuing company and the investors. They detail the number of shares to be purchased, the price per share, the payment terms, and any other obligations or rights associated with the shares. These agreements are crucial in protecting the interests of both parties and ensuring transparent and smooth transactions.

In mathematical terms, subscribed share capital can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Subscribed Share Capital} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (P_i \times Q_i)
$$

where $P_i$ is the agreed price per share, $Q_i$ is the quantity of shares committed by investor $i$, and $n$ is the total number of subscribing investors.

This structure provides companies with a mechanism to gauge investor interest and allocate shares efficiently. During the IPO period, subscription data can also serve as an indicator of market demand and help adjust the offering price accordingly.

In conclusion, subscribed share capital plays a fundamental role in corporate finance, particularly in capital-raising scenarios like IPOs. Through subscription agreements, companies and investors establish the groundwork for transactions, balancing expectations with obligations and contributing to the overall financial ecosystem.

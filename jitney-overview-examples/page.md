```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Assume X_train contains features like traffic density, weather conditions, and Y_train is the demand

model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Predicting demand for a new set of conditions
X_new = np.array([[traffic_density, weather_condition]])
predicted_demand = model.predict(X_new)
```

In algorithmic trading, AI and ML can enhance strategies through improved decision-making.

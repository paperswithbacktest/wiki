```python
import requests

api_key = 'your_api_key'
api_secret = 'your_api_secret'
base_url = 'https://api.gemini.com'
order_endpoint = '/v1/order/new'

order_payload = {
    'request': order_endpoint,
    'nonce': 123456,
    'symbol': 'btcusd',
    'amount': '0.01',
    'price': '50000',
    'side': 'buy',
    'type': 'exchange limit'
}

response = requests.post(base_url + order_endpoint, json=order_payload, auth=(api_key, api_secret))
print(response.json())
```

For traders requiring real-time data and order updates, the **WebSocket API** is vital. It enables the reception of live market data and provides immediate updates on order statuses, which is crucial for executing time-sensitive trading strategies. Unlike the REST API, the WebSocket API establishes a persistent connection that allows data to be pushed from the server to the client, improving latency for real-time applications. This is particularly important when market conditions change rapidly, requiring instant reactions by trading algorithms.

The **FIX API** is predominantly used by institutional traders who engage in high-frequency trading operations. Known for its speed and efficiency, the FIX API allows transactions to be processed with minimal latency, providing increased transaction speed and reliability. This protocol is internationally recognized and widely used across financial markets, offering standardized communication for order handling and execution.

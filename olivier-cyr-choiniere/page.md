## Olivier Cyr-Choinière

Olivier Cyr-Choinière is a notable figure in the fields of quantitative finance and algorithmic trading, with a multidisciplinary background in physics, engineering, and finance. Born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, he has made significant contributions to the scientific community, particularly in the domain of high-temperature superconductors, while transitioning into the competitive realm of financial engineering and algorithmic trading.

### Early Life and Education

Olivier Cyr-Choinière undertook his initial academic endeavors at the Université de Montréal, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from 2004 to 2007. He furthered his studies at the Université de Sherbrooke, obtaining a Master's in Physics with a focus on superconductivity from 2007 to 2009, and subsequently a PhD in the same field from 2010 to 2014. Cyr-Choinière's doctoral research involved thermo-electric measurements in high-temperature superconductors, which later resulted in numerous influential publications and citations within the scientific community.

### Academic and Research Career

Cyr-Choinière's early career is marked by a series of prestigious postdoctoral research fellowships. From 2015 to 2017, he was appointed as a Postdoctoral Fellow at McGill University, where he worked within the interdisciplinary fields of Physics and Electrical Engineering. Here, he focused on developing innovative experimental tools for novel transistor technology. Following his tenure at McGill, he took on a Postdoctoral Associate position at Yale University from 2017 to 2018 in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science. His work gained recognition for its innovative approach to robotics, supported by a grant from NASA.

A highlighted project during his time at Yale was the development of a unique soft robot capable of sensing and locomotion via robotic skins, capturing attention at global venues such as Jeff Bezos’ MARS 2019 conference.

### Transition to Financial Engineering

Deciding to leverage his extensive background in scientific research and complex problem solving, Cyr-Choinière shifted towards financial engineering in pursuit of innovative applications of [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning) in finance. He attained a Master's degree in Financial Engineering from HEC Montréal between 2020 and 2022.

His work in finance has particularly focused on the development and optimization of [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) strategies, machine learning models, and risk assessments. These skills were honed during stints at firms like Trans-Canada Capital and Fonds BNI - HEC Montréal, where he notably optimized [ETF](/wiki/etf-trading-strategies) fixed income allocations and validated valuation models for financial instruments.

### Professional Career in Finance

As a quantitative analyst, Cyr-Choinière joined Nymbus Capital in May 2023. At Nymbus Capital, he focuses on developing advanced financial models that utilize machine learning to enhance portfolio management and financial predictions across different asset classes.

Prior to his current role, Cyr-Choinière briefly worked at Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) as a Quantitative Analyst specializing in Fixed Income, where he applied machine learning techniques critically to predict fixed income indices performance. His role at CDPQ marked a significant application of his research skills in real-world financial contexts.

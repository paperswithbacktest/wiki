## What historical events led to the creation of SEC Release IA-1092?

SEC Release IA-1092 was created because of some big problems that happened in the investment world. Before 1987, there were cases where investment advisers did not handle their clients' money the right way. Some advisers mixed their clients' money with their own money, which made it hard to keep track of everything. This led to people losing trust in advisers because they were not sure if their money was safe. The SEC saw these problems and decided that new rules were needed to make sure advisers followed the law and kept their clients' money safe.

The release came out in 1987, right before a big stock market crash known as Black Monday. This crash made people even more worried about their investments. The SEC wanted to make sure that advisers were doing everything they could to protect their clients' money during such scary times. By setting clear rules about how advisers should handle money and keep records, the SEC hoped to make the investment adviser industry more trustworthy and help people feel more secure about their investments.

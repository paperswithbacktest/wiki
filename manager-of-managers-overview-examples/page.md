state_space_size = env.observation_space.n
action_space_size = env.action_space.n
Q_table = np.zeros((state_space_size, action_space_size))

# Reinforcement learning loop
for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        if np.random.uniform(0, 1) < epsilon:
            # Explore action space
            action = env.action_space.sample()
        else:
            # Exploit learned values
            action = np.argmax(Q_table[state, :])

        # Take action and observe reward
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

        # Update Q-table using the Bellman equation
        Q_table[state, action] = Q_table[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q_table[next_state, :]) - Q_table[state, action])

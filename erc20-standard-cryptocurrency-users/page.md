# Define the smart contract address and ABI
contract_address = '0xYourERC20TokenAddress'
abi = [...]  # Provide ERC20 contract ABI here

# Create contract instance
contract = w3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=abi)

# Function to check balance and perform trading action
def check_and_trade(account, threshold):
    balance = contract.functions.balanceOf(account).call()
    if balance > threshold:
        # Execute trading logic or smart contract function
        print(f"Balance is above {threshold}, executing trade")

# Example usage
check_and_trade('0xYourAccountAddress', 1000)
```

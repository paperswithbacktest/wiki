import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example dataset with stock prices
data = {'Price': [100, 102, 104, 103, 101, 105, 107, 106, 108]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate short-term and long-term moving averages
short_window = 3
long_window = 5

df['Short_MA'] = df['Price'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
df['Long_MA'] = df['Price'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

# Trade signals
df['Signal'] = np.where(df['Short_MA'] > df['Long_MA'], 1.0, 0.0)
df['Position'] = df['Signal'].diff()

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(df['Price'], label='Price')
plt.plot(df['Short_MA'], label='Short MA')
plt.plot(df['Long_MA'], label='Long MA')
plt.plot(df[df['Position'] == 1].index, df['Short_MA'][df['Position'] == 1], '^', markersize=10, color='g', label='Buy Signal')
plt.plot(df[df['Position'] == -1].index, df['Short_MA'][df['Position'] == -1], 'v', markersize=10, color='r', label='Sell Signal')
plt.title('Price History with Buy/Sell Signals')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This example illustrates how investors can automate buying and selling signals based on predefined criteria, enhancing the precision and timing of investment choices. By integrating algorithmic trading, investors not only optimize their resource allocation but also navigate the complex and dynamic nature of healthcare investments more effectively.

```python
import cbpro

class TradingBot:
    def __init__(self, api_key, api_secret, passphrase):
        self.auth_client = cbpro.AuthenticatedClient(api_key, api_secret, passphrase)

    def get_account_balance(self):
        accounts = self.auth_client.get_accounts()
        for account in accounts:
            print(account)

    def execute_trade(self, side, product_id, price, size):
        if side == "buy":
            order = self.auth_client.buy(price=price, size=size, order_type='limit', product_id=product_id)
        elif side == "sell":
            order = self.auth_client.sell(price=price, size=size, order_type='limit', product_id=product_id)
        print(order)

# Example usage:
# bot = TradingBot('your_api_key', 'your_api_secret', 'your_passphrase')
# bot.get_account_balance()
# bot.execute_trade('buy', 'BTC-USD', '30000.00', '0.01')
```

Each model has distinct applications, strengths, and limitations in forecasting and predictions.

### Regression Models

Regression models are a fundamental tool in predictive analytics used to understand relationships between variables and predict a continuous outcome. The simplest form, linear regression, seeks to model the relationship between a dependent variable $Y$ and one or more independent variables $X$ using a linear equation:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots + \beta_nX_n + \epsilon
$$

where $\beta$ represents the coefficients, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

**Applications:** Linear regression is often used in financial forecasting, such as predicting stock prices based on market indicators.

**Strengths:** These models are easy to interpret and computationally efficient, making them suitable for scenarios where relationships between variables are linear and datasets are not too large.

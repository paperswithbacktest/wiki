## What is shareholders' equity?

Shareholders' equity is the amount of money that would be left over if a company sold all of its assets and paid off all of its debts. It represents the owners' claim on the company's assets after all liabilities have been settled. You can find this number on a company's balance sheet, and it's also known as net assets or owner's equity.

Think of it like this: if you own a lemonade stand and you have $100 in cash, a stand worth $50, and you owe $30 to your friend for the lemons, your shareholders' equity would be $120. That's because if you sold your stand and paid back your friend, you'd have $120 left. This number is important because it shows how much the business is worth to its owners.

## How is shareholders' equity calculated?

Shareholders' equity is calculated by taking the total assets of a company and subtracting its total liabilities. This gives you the net worth of the company, which is what the shareholders own. For example, if a company has $1,000 in assets and $600 in liabilities, the shareholders' equity would be $400.

You can also think of shareholders' equity as the amount of money that would be left if the company sold everything it owns and paid off all its debts. This number is important because it shows how much the business is worth to its owners. It's a key part of a company's balance sheet and helps investors understand the financial health of the business.

## What does negative shareholders' equity mean?

Negative shareholders' equity means that a company's liabilities are more than its assets. This can happen if a company has a lot of debt or if it loses a lot of money. When a company's liabilities are bigger than its assets, it means that if the company sold everything it owns, it still wouldn't have enough money to pay off all its debts.

This situation can be a warning sign for investors. It might mean that the company is in financial trouble and could be at risk of going bankrupt. However, sometimes a company might have negative shareholders' equity for other reasons, like if it has been buying back its own shares or if it has a lot of intangible assets that aren't counted on the balance sheet. So, it's important to look at the whole picture before deciding if negative shareholders' equity is a big problem.

## What are the common causes of negative shareholders' equity?

Negative shareholders' equity happens when a company's debts are more than its assets. This can happen if a company loses a lot of money over time. For example, if a business keeps spending more money than it makes, its assets will go down and its debts might go up. Another reason could be if a company takes on a lot of debt to grow or buy other companies. If the new investments don't make enough money, the company's debts can become bigger than its assets.

Another common cause is when a company buys back its own shares. When a company does this, it uses its cash to buy the shares, which reduces its assets. If the company doesn't have enough other assets to cover its debts, this can lead to negative shareholders' equity. Also, sometimes a company might have a lot of intangible assets, like patents or brand value, that aren't counted on the balance sheet. If these aren't included in the asset value, the company might look like it has negative shareholders' equity even if it's doing well.

It's important to understand that negative shareholders' equity doesn't always mean a company is in trouble. Sometimes, it might be part of a bigger plan to grow or change the business. But it's a good idea to look at the whole financial picture to see if the company is really struggling or if there's a good reason for the negative equity.

## Can a company with negative shareholders' equity still be profitable?

Yes, a company with negative shareholders' equity can still be profitable. Profitability means that the company is making more money than it spends in a given period, like a year. This is different from shareholders' equity, which is about the company's total value after paying off all its debts. A company can have negative shareholders' equity because of past losses or high debt, but if it's making money now, it can still be profitable.

For example, a company might have taken on a lot of debt to grow or buy other businesses. Even if this leads to negative shareholders' equity, the company can still make profits from its operations. As long as the company's income is higher than its expenses, it's profitable. So, negative shareholders' equity doesn't always mean a company is doing badly; it just means the company's debts are more than its assets at that moment.

## How does negative shareholders' equity affect a company's ability to secure loans?

Negative shareholders' equity can make it harder for a company to get loans. When a bank looks at a company's balance sheet and sees that the company's debts are more than its assets, it might worry that the company won't be able to pay back the loan. Banks want to make sure they get their money back, so they might see negative shareholders' equity as a sign that the company is risky. This can make them less likely to give the company a loan, or they might charge a higher [interest rate](/wiki/interest-rate-trading-strategies) to cover the extra risk.

However, it's not always a deal-breaker. If a company can show that it's making profits and has a good plan to turn things around, some banks might still be willing to lend money. They might look at other things, like the company's cash flow, its history of paying back loans, and its future plans. So, while negative shareholders' equity can make it harder to get a loan, it's not impossible if the company can prove it's on the right track.

## What are the long-term implications of negative shareholders' equity for a company?

Negative shareholders' equity can have serious long-term effects on a company. If a company's debts are more than its assets for a long time, it might struggle to get new loans or investments. Banks and investors might see the company as risky and might not want to give it money. This can make it hard for the company to grow or even to keep running its business. If the company can't find ways to make more money or pay off its debts, it might have to close down or go bankrupt.

On the other hand, negative shareholders' equity doesn't always mean a company is in big trouble. Sometimes, a company might have negative equity because it's investing a lot in its future. If the company can start making more money and paying off its debts, the negative equity might go away. But it's important for the company to have a good plan and to keep an eye on its finances. If it can turn things around, negative shareholders' equity might just be a bump in the road, not the end of the story.

## How do investors typically view companies with negative shareholders' equity?

Investors often see companies with negative shareholders' equity as risky. When a company's debts are more than its assets, it might mean the company is not doing well financially. Investors worry that if the company has to sell everything it owns, it still won't have enough money to pay off all its debts. This can make investors think twice about putting their money into the company because they might not get their money back.

However, not all investors see negative shareholders' equity the same way. Some might look deeper into the company's situation. They might see that the company is making profits or has a good plan to pay off its debts. If they believe the company can turn things around, they might still be willing to invest. So, while negative shareholders' equity can be a warning sign, it doesn't always scare off every investor.

## What strategies can a company employ to improve its negative shareholders' equity?

A company can improve its negative shareholders' equity by focusing on making more money than it spends. This means cutting costs and finding ways to increase its income. For example, the company might stop spending on things it doesn't need, like fancy office spaces or extra staff. It could also try to sell more products or services, maybe by offering discounts or finding new customers. If the company can make more money than it spends, it will start to build up its assets and slowly pay off its debts, which will help improve its shareholders' equity.

Another way to improve negative shareholders' equity is by paying off debts. The company might try to get a loan with a lower interest rate to pay off other, more expensive debts. It could also talk to its lenders about changing the terms of its loans to make them easier to pay back. If the company can reduce its debts, its liabilities will go down, which can help turn its shareholders' equity from negative to positive. It's important for the company to have a good plan and to keep an eye on its finances to make sure it's moving in the right direction.

## Can negative shareholders' equity lead to bankruptcy?

Yes, negative shareholders' equity can lead to bankruptcy. When a company's debts are more than its assets, it means that if the company sold everything it owns, it still wouldn't have enough money to pay off all its debts. This can make it hard for the company to get new loans or investments because banks and investors might see it as too risky. If the company can't find a way to make more money or pay off its debts, it might not be able to keep running its business and could end up going bankrupt.

However, negative shareholders' equity doesn't always mean a company will go bankrupt. Sometimes, a company might have negative equity because it's investing a lot in its future. If the company can start making more money and paying off its debts, the negative equity might go away. It's important for the company to have a good plan and to keep an eye on its finances. If it can turn things around, negative shareholders' equity might just be a temporary problem, not the end of the story.

## How is negative shareholders' equity reported and disclosed in financial statements?

Negative shareholders' equity is shown on a company's balance sheet, which is one of the main financial statements. The balance sheet lists all the company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. If the total liabilities are more than the total assets, the shareholders' equity section will show a negative number. This negative number is usually written in parentheses or with a minus sign to make it clear that it's a negative value. The balance sheet helps people see the company's financial health at a specific time, so it's important to show negative shareholders' equity clearly.

Companies also have to explain negative shareholders' equity in their financial reports. This is usually done in the notes to the financial statements or in the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) section. In these notes, the company will talk about why its shareholders' equity is negative and what it's doing to fix the problem. This helps investors and other people understand the company's situation better. By being open about negative shareholders' equity, the company can help people see the full picture of its financial health.

## What are some real-world examples of companies that have experienced negative shareholders' equity and how did they recover?

One real-world example of a company with negative shareholders' equity is Tesla. In 2018, Tesla had negative shareholders' equity due to its heavy investments in growth and expansion. The company was spending a lot of money to build new factories and develop new products. Even though it had negative shareholders' equity, Tesla was able to recover by focusing on increasing its sales and production. By 2020, Tesla started making profits and its shareholders' equity turned positive again. This shows that negative shareholders' equity doesn't always mean a company is in trouble, especially if it has a good plan to grow and make more money.

Another example is Delta Air Lines. In 2005, Delta went bankrupt and had negative shareholders' equity because of high debts and the impact of rising fuel costs. After going through bankruptcy, Delta came up with a new plan to pay off its debts and improve its financial health. The company cut costs, sold some of its assets, and focused on making its operations more efficient. Over time, Delta was able to turn things around and its shareholders' equity became positive again. This shows that even if a company has negative shareholders' equity and goes bankrupt, it can still recover if it makes the right changes and sticks to a good plan.

## What is Shareholders' Equity?

Shareholders' equity, often referred to as stockholders' equity, represents the residual interest in the assets of a company after deducting liabilities. It is the net worth of a company and is a fundamental indicator of its financial health. The formula for calculating shareholders' equity is:

$$
\text{Shareholders' Equity} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}
$$

This measure provides insight into a company's capacity to fulfill its obligations and its potential for growth. A positive shareholders' equity indicates that a company has more assets than liabilities, suggesting financial stability and the potential for expansion. Conversely, a negative shareholders' equity might suggest financial distress, signaling that liabilities exceed assets.

Shareholders' equity is comprised of capital contributed by shareholders, known as paid-in capital, and retained earnings, which are the cumulative net income retained by the company instead of being distributed as dividends. Additional components may include treasury stock, which represents shares that the company has repurchased. 

Key financial ratios derived from shareholders' equity, such as the return on equity (ROE), offer insight into how efficiently a company is using investments to generate earnings growth. ROE is calculated as:

$$
\text{Return on Equity (ROE)} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}}
$$

A higher ROE indicates more efficient use of equity investments. 

Understanding shareholders' equity is essential for investors, creditors, and analysts for assessing a company’s financial health, investment potential, and capacity to sustain operations and growth over time. As such, it serves as a critical barometer in financial analysis, influencing investment strategies and decision-making processes.

## What are the causes of negative equity?

Negative equity arises when a company's liabilities surpass its assets, resulting in a deficit in shareholders' equity. This situation often signals underlying financial challenges and can occur due to several reasons.

Accumulated losses over time are a primary cause of negative equity. When a corporation consistently spends more than it earns, its retained earnings diminish, potentially turning negative if the losses persist. In accounting terms, retained earnings (RE) can be represented as:

$$
\text{RE} = \text{Beginning RE} + \text{Net Income} - \text{Dividends}
$$

A continuous reporting of net losses reduces retained earnings, and if dividends are disbursed simultaneously, it could lead to negative equity.

Excessive dividend payments that exceed retained earnings can exacerbate the situation. When companies distribute more in dividends than they have accrued in retained earnings, they chip away at their equity base. This practice might support shareholder satisfaction in the short term, but if it's not backed by equivalent earnings, it jeopardizes long-term financial stability. For instance, if a company's retained earnings are \$500,000 and it pays dividends of \$600,000, the shortfall adds to the deficit, directly affecting the company's equity.

Lastly, large borrowings without concurrent income or asset growth constitute another risk [factor](/wiki/factor-investing) for negative equity. When companies take on significant debt without parallel increases in income or asset value, their liabilities surpass their assets. This imbalance becomes apparent in the balance sheet equation:

$$
\text{Equity} = \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities}
$$

If liabilities grow disproportionately due to borrowing, without corresponding asset augmentation or revenue increase, the equation results in negative equity. For instance, if a firm borrows \$1 million but generates only a \$500,000 increase in asset value or income, the unbalanced equation impacts the net equity adversely.

Each of these factors—accumulated losses, imprudent dividend payouts, and disproportionate borrowing—can independently or collectively cause negative equity, highlighting the importance of vigilant financial management to maintain a stable equity foundation.

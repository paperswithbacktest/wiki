## How does OpenSea ensure the security of transactions?

OpenSea works hard to keep your transactions safe. They use something called blockchain technology, which is like a super secure digital ledger that records all the transactions.

OpenSea also uses smart contracts, which are like automatic agreements that make sure the rules of the transaction are followed without anyone needing to do extra work.

When you buy or sell something on OpenSea, the money goes directly from your wallet to the seller's wallet, without OpenSea touching it. This helps keep your money and your NFTs safe. Plus, OpenSea has a team that works to stop any bad stuff from happening on their site, so they're always watching out for you.

## What is the role of Ethereum in OpenSea?

Ethereum plays a big role in how OpenSea works. It's the main type of [cryptocurrency](/wiki/cryptocurrency) that people use to buy and sell NFTs on the platform.

This makes sure that once a deal is done, it can't be changed or messed with easily. Plus, there's something called gas fees, which you pay in Ethereum, that help cover the cost of using the blockchain to process your transactions. So, Ethereum is not just the money you use on OpenSea, it's also what helps make the whole system work smoothly and safely.

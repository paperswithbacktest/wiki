## What is the International Poverty Line?

The International Poverty Line is a measure used to determine how many people around the world live in extreme poverty. It is set by the World Bank and is currently defined as living on less than $2.15 per day. This amount is adjusted for inflation and differences in the cost of living between countries, so it represents the same standard of living everywhere.

This line helps governments and organizations understand where help is needed most. By comparing the number of people below this line in different countries, they can see which places are struggling the most and plan how to help. It's a useful tool for making sure aid and resources go to the people who need them the most.

## How is the International Poverty Line calculated?

The International Poverty Line is figured out by the World Bank. They look at how much money people need to buy the basic things they need to live, like food, shelter, and clothes. They start by checking the prices of these basic things in the poorest countries. Then, they use a special way of comparing prices called "purchasing power parity" to make sure the amount of money means the same thing in different countries. This helps them set a line that shows when someone is living in extreme poverty.

Once they have the basic numbers, the World Bank updates the poverty line every few years to keep up with changes in prices and the cost of living. They use new data from around the world to make sure the line stays accurate. This way, the International Poverty Line can show how many people are living in extreme poverty at any given time, helping countries and organizations plan how to help those in need.

## What is the current threshold for the International Poverty Line?

The current threshold for the International Poverty Line is set at $2.15 per day. This number is used by the World Bank to measure extreme poverty around the world. It's based on the cost of basic needs like food, shelter, and clothing in the poorest countries, adjusted so it means the same thing everywhere.

This line helps people understand how many are living in extreme poverty. It's updated every few years to keep up with changes in prices and the cost of living. By using this line, governments and organizations can see where help is needed most and plan how to support those who are struggling.

## How has the International Poverty Line changed over time?

The International Poverty Line has changed over time to keep up with how prices and the cost of living change. When it first started in 1990, the World Bank set the line at $1 per day. This was based on what it cost to buy the basic things people need in the poorest countries. As prices went up, the World Bank had to update the line to make sure it still showed who was living in extreme poverty. In 2008, they changed it to $1.25 per day, and then in 2015, it went up to $1.90 per day.

In 2022, the World Bank updated the International Poverty Line again, raising it to $2.15 per day. They did this because they wanted to use new data and better ways to compare prices around the world. This new line helps show how many people are living in extreme poverty more accurately. By changing the line over time, the World Bank makes sure it's a useful tool for understanding where help is needed most and how to plan to help those people.

## Which organization sets the International Poverty Line?

The World Bank is the organization that sets the International Poverty Line. They look at how much money people need to buy basic things like food, shelter, and clothes in the poorest countries. Then, they use a special way of comparing prices called "purchasing power parity" to make sure the amount of money means the same thing everywhere.

The World Bank updates the International Poverty Line every few years. They do this to keep up with changes in prices and the cost of living. By doing this, they can show how many people are living in extreme poverty and help governments and organizations plan how to help those in need.

## How does the International Poverty Line differ from national poverty lines?

The International Poverty Line and national poverty lines are used to measure poverty, but they are different in some ways. The International Poverty Line is set by the World Bank and is used to see how many people around the world live in extreme poverty. It is the same for every country and is currently set at $2.15 per day. This line helps to compare poverty across different countries and see where help is needed the most.

On the other hand, national poverty lines are set by each country's government. They are based on what it costs to live in that specific country, so they can be different from one country to another. For example, what is considered poor in one country might not be the same in another because the cost of living is different. National poverty lines help governments understand how many of their own people are living in poverty and plan how to help them.

Both the International Poverty Line and national poverty lines are important. The International Poverty Line gives a global view of extreme poverty, while national poverty lines give a more detailed look at poverty within each country. Together, they help governments and organizations around the world fight poverty more effectively.

## What are the main criticisms of the International Poverty Line?

Some people say the International Poverty Line has problems. One big issue is that it uses the same number for every country, but the cost of living is different in different places. For example, $2.15 might buy a lot in one country but not enough in another. This means the line might not show the real situation in some countries. Also, the line only looks at how much money people have, not other important things like health care, education, and safety. These things can make a big difference in people's lives, but the International Poverty Line doesn't count them.

Another criticism is that the line is set by the World Bank, which is based in richer countries. Some people think this means the line might not really understand the problems faced by people in poorer countries. They worry that the World Bank might not listen enough to what people in those countries say about what they need. Also, because the line is updated every few years, it might not keep up with quick changes in prices or the cost of living. This can make the line less accurate over time.

## How does the International Poverty Line impact global poverty reduction strategies?

The International Poverty Line helps shape how countries and groups around the world try to reduce poverty. It gives a clear number that everyone can use to see how many people are living in extreme poverty. This helps them decide where to send help and money. For example, if a country has a lot of people below the line, it might get more aid from other countries or groups. This line also helps track progress over time. If fewer people are below the line each year, it shows that efforts to reduce poverty are working.

However, the International Poverty Line also has some problems that can affect how well poverty reduction strategies work. Because it uses the same number for every country, it might not show the real situation in places where the cost of living is different. This can lead to some countries getting more help than they need, while others might not get enough. Also, the line only looks at money, not other important things like health care and education. This means that some strategies might focus too much on giving people money and not enough on other things that can help them get out of poverty.

## What are the arguments in favor of using the International Poverty Line?

One big reason to use the International Poverty Line is that it gives a clear way to see how many people around the world are living in extreme poverty. It's the same number for every country, so it's easy to compare different places and see where help is needed the most. This helps governments and groups decide where to send money and resources. It also helps track progress over time. If fewer people are below the line each year, it shows that efforts to reduce poverty are working.

Another reason to use the International Poverty Line is that it's set by the World Bank, which has a lot of experience and data from around the world. The World Bank updates the line every few years to keep up with changes in prices and the cost of living. This makes sure the line stays accurate and useful. Even though it has some problems, the International Poverty Line is a helpful tool for understanding global poverty and planning how to help people who are struggling.

## How does the International Poverty Line affect policy-making in developing countries?

The International Poverty Line helps shape policy-making in developing countries by giving them a clear goal to aim for. When a country knows how many of its people are living below this line, it can make plans to help them. For example, a government might decide to spend more money on programs that give poor people food, homes, or jobs. This line also helps countries see if their efforts to reduce poverty are working. If fewer people are below the line each year, it shows that the policies are helping.

However, the International Poverty Line can also make things harder for developing countries. Because it uses the same number for every country, it might not show the real situation in places where the cost of living is different. This can lead to some countries getting more help than they need, while others might not get enough. Also, the line only looks at money, not other important things like health care and education. This means that some policies might focus too much on giving people money and not enough on other things that can help them get out of poverty.

## What alternative measures to the International Poverty Line have been proposed?

Some people think the International Poverty Line doesn't show the whole picture of poverty, so they have come up with other ways to measure it. One idea is the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). This measure looks at more than just money. It checks if people have enough food, clean water, education, and health care. By looking at all these things, the MPI can show a more complete view of poverty and help countries plan better ways to help their people.

Another alternative is the use of national poverty lines. These lines are set by each country based on what it costs to live there. This means they can be different from one country to another. Using national poverty lines can help governments understand poverty in their own country more accurately and make plans that fit their specific needs. However, it can be harder to compare poverty across different countries when each one uses a different line.

Both the MPI and national poverty lines try to give a fuller picture of poverty than the International Poverty Line. They can help governments and groups see where help is needed most and make better plans to reduce poverty. But they also have their own problems, like being harder to compare across countries or needing a lot of detailed data.

## How do variations in cost of living and purchasing power affect the applicability of the International Poverty Line across different countries?

The International Poverty Line is the same number for every country, which can make it hard to use in places where the cost of living is different. For example, $2.15 might be enough to buy food and other basic things in one country, but it might not be enough in another country where things are more expensive. This means that the line might not show the real situation in some countries. If a country has a higher cost of living, more people might be living in poverty than the International Poverty Line shows. On the other hand, in a country where things are cheaper, the line might make it look like fewer people are poor than they really are.

To try to fix this problem, the World Bank uses a special way of comparing prices called "purchasing power parity." This method tries to make sure that the amount of money means the same thing everywhere. But even with this, the International Poverty Line can still be hard to use in different countries. The line only looks at how much money people have, not other important things like health care and education. These things can make a big difference in people's lives, but the International Poverty Line doesn't count them. So, while the line is helpful for comparing poverty around the world, it might not show the full picture of poverty in each country.

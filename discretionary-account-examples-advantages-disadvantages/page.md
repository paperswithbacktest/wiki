## What is a discretionary account?

A discretionary account is a type of investment account where the account holder gives permission to a broker or financial advisor to make investment decisions on their behalf. This means that the broker can buy or sell assets like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds without needing to ask the account holder for approval each time. The main advantage of this type of account is that it allows for quick decision-making and can potentially lead to better investment performance because the broker can act swiftly on market opportunities.

However, there are also risks involved with discretionary accounts. Since the broker has the authority to make trades, the account holder must trust that the broker will act in their best interest. It's important for the account holder to choose a reputable and experienced broker and to clearly understand the investment strategy and goals. Regular communication and monitoring of the account's performance are also crucial to ensure that the broker's actions align with the account holder's financial objectives.

## How does a discretionary account differ from a non-discretionary account?

A discretionary account and a non-discretionary account are two different types of investment accounts. In a discretionary account, the account holder gives the broker or financial advisor the power to make investment choices without asking for permission each time. This means the broker can buy or sell stocks, bonds, or other investments whenever they think it's a good idea. This can be helpful because the broker can act quickly on good opportunities in the market.

On the other hand, a non-discretionary account requires the broker to get approval from the account holder before making any trades. The account holder has to agree to each investment decision before the broker can act. This gives the account holder more control over their investments, but it can also mean missing out on quick market moves because the broker has to wait for approval.

Both types of accounts have their own benefits and risks. A discretionary account can lead to better performance if the broker is skilled and trustworthy, but it requires a lot of trust in the broker. A non-discretionary account gives the account holder more control and peace of mind, but it might not be as responsive to fast-changing market conditions.

## Can you provide examples of discretionary accounts?

A discretionary account is like giving a friend permission to pick out your snacks at the store without checking with you first. For example, imagine you hire a financial advisor to manage your retirement savings. You tell them your goals, like saving enough to retire comfortably, and they have the power to choose which stocks or bonds to buy or sell. They can do this without calling you every time, so if they see a good opportunity, they can act fast.

Another example is when someone with a busy schedule wants to invest but doesn't have time to make decisions themselves. They might open a discretionary account with a broker. The broker knows the person wants to grow their money over time, so the broker can buy and sell different investments to try to make that happen. This way, the person can focus on their job or family, knowing their money is being managed by someone they trust.

## Who typically uses discretionary accounts?

People who use discretionary accounts are often busy and don't have time to manage their investments every day. They might be doctors, lawyers, or business owners who trust a financial advisor to make good choices for them. These people want to grow their money but can't watch the market all the time, so they let someone else do it for them.

Others who use these accounts are those who don't know much about investing but want to start. They might be new to the world of stocks and bonds and feel more comfortable letting a professional handle it. By using a discretionary account, they can still invest and hopefully see their money grow, without needing to learn everything about the market themselves.

## What are the advantages of using a discretionary account?

One big advantage of using a discretionary account is that it saves you time. If you're busy with work or family, you don't have to worry about watching the stock market every day. You can trust your broker to make the right choices for you. This means you can focus on other important things in your life, while still knowing that your money is being taken care of.

Another advantage is that a discretionary account can help you make money faster. Because your broker can act quickly on good opportunities, they might be able to buy or sell at better times than if you had to approve each trade. This can lead to better returns on your investments. Plus, if you're not very experienced with investing, a skilled broker can make better decisions than you might on your own.

## What are the potential disadvantages of discretionary accounts?

One big disadvantage of using a discretionary account is that you have to trust your broker a lot. Since they can make choices without asking you, they might not always do what you would want. If you pick a broker who isn't good at their job or doesn't care about your goals, your money might not grow as much as you hoped. It's important to find a broker you can really trust and to keep checking on what they're doing with your money.

Another disadvantage is that you might miss out on learning about investing. If you let someone else handle all your investment decisions, you won't get to practice making your own choices and learning from them. Over time, this could mean you never get comfortable with investing on your own. Plus, if you don't keep a close eye on your account, you might not notice if something goes wrong until it's too late.

## How is the performance of a discretionary account typically measured?

The performance of a discretionary account is usually measured by looking at how much the account has grown over time. This is often done by calculating the percentage increase in the account's value. For example, if you started with $10,000 and it grew to $11,000, that's a 10% increase. People also look at how the account is doing compared to a benchmark, like the S&P 500. If your account did better than the benchmark, that's a good sign that your broker is making smart choices.

Another way to measure performance is by checking how well the account is meeting your goals. If you wanted to save for a house in five years, you'd see if the account is on track to reach that amount. It's also important to look at the risk involved. If your account grew a lot but took big risks to do it, you might not be happy if you prefer a safer approach. Regular reviews with your broker can help you understand if the account is performing the way you want it to.

## What legal and regulatory considerations should be noted with discretionary accounts?

When you use a discretionary account, there are important rules and laws to keep in mind. Brokers who manage these accounts have to follow strict rules set by organizations like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). These rules are there to make sure the broker acts in your best interest and doesn't do anything shady. For example, they have to keep good records of all the trades they make and explain their choices if you ask. They also need to make sure they understand your goals and how much risk you're okay with before they start making decisions for you.

Another important thing to know is that you have to sign a special agreement to open a discretionary account. This agreement gives the broker permission to make trades without asking you each time. It's a big deal, so it's important to read it carefully and understand what you're agreeing to. Also, even though the broker can make choices without your okay, you still need to keep an eye on what they're doing. You can ask for regular updates and reports to make sure they're sticking to your goals and not taking too many risks. If you ever feel like something's not right, you can talk to the broker or even report it to the regulators.

## How can one set up a discretionary account?

To set up a discretionary account, you first need to find a reputable broker or financial advisor who you trust to manage your investments. You can do this by asking friends or family for recommendations, or by researching online. Once you've chosen a broker, you'll need to open an account with them. This usually involves filling out an application form and providing some personal information, like your social security number and details about your financial goals and how much risk you're comfortable with.

After your account is opened, you'll need to sign a discretionary agreement. This is a special document that gives your broker the permission to make investment decisions without asking you each time. It's important to read this agreement carefully and make sure you understand what you're agreeing to. Once everything is set up, you'll need to fund your account by transferring money into it. From there, your broker can start managing your investments according to the goals and risk levels you've discussed.

## What role does a financial advisor play in managing a discretionary account?

A financial advisor plays a big role in managing a discretionary account. They are the ones who make all the investment choices for you. This means they decide when to buy or sell stocks, bonds, or other investments without asking you first. They do this based on what they know about your goals and how much risk you're okay with. It's important for them to understand your financial dreams, like saving for retirement or buying a house, so they can make choices that help you reach those goals.

The advisor also has to keep you updated on how your account is doing. They should give you regular reports and be ready to explain their decisions if you ask. This helps you feel confident that they're doing a good job. If you ever have questions or want to change something, you can talk to them. They're there to help make sure your money is growing in a way that matches what you want.

## How do fees and costs associated with discretionary accounts work?

Fees and costs for discretionary accounts can vary depending on the broker or financial advisor you choose. Usually, you'll have to pay a management fee, which is a percentage of the total money in your account. This fee is for the advisor's work in managing your investments. For example, if your account has $100,000 and the management fee is 1%, you'll pay $1,000 a year. Sometimes, there might also be other fees, like transaction fees for buying or selling investments, or fees for certain types of investments like mutual funds.

It's important to understand all the fees before you start a discretionary account. Ask your broker to explain everything clearly so you know what you're paying for. Some advisors might charge a flat fee instead of a percentage, or they might have different fee structures based on the services they offer. Knowing all the costs upfront helps you see how much of your money is going towards fees and how much is actually growing in your account.

## What advanced strategies can be implemented using a discretionary account?

With a discretionary account, a financial advisor can use advanced strategies like tactical asset allocation. This means they can change the mix of your investments based on what's happening in the market. For example, if they think stocks are going to do well, they might put more of your money into stocks. If they think the market is risky, they might move some money into safer investments like bonds. This kind of strategy can help your account grow more because it can take advantage of good opportunities and avoid big losses.

Another strategy is using options and derivatives. These are special kinds of investments that can be used to protect your money or make more from it. For example, the advisor might use options to limit how much you could lose if the market goes down. They might also use them to try to make extra money if they think the market will go up. These strategies can be complicated, but a good advisor can use them to help your account perform better over time.

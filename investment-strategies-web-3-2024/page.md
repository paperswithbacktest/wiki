    order_book = exchange.fetch_order_book(symbol)
    bid = order_book['bids'][0][0]
    ask = order_book['asks'][0][0]

    # Calculate the mid price
    mid_price = (bid + ask) / 2
    buy_price = mid_price - spread / 2
    sell_price = mid_price + spread / 2

    # Place buy and sell limit orders
    exchange.create_limit_buy_order(symbol, 1, buy_price)
    exchange.create_limit_sell_order(symbol, 1, sell_price)

    # Sleep before checking again
    time.sleep(60)
```

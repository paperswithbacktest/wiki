## History and Background of Newedge

Newedge was established in January 2008 as a joint venture between two prominent financial institutions, Société Générale and Crédit Agricole. This collaboration marked the inception of Newedge Group, positioned as one of the leading global multi-asset brokerage platforms. Initially, the firm was crafted to leverage the combined heritage and expertise of its parent organizations.

The foundation of Newedge was built upon the strengths of two well-established entities: Fimat and Calyon Financial. Fimat, a subsidiary of Société Générale, was known for its comprehensive range of brokerage services, particularly in the derivatives market. Calyon Financial, under the umbrella of Crédit Agricole CIB, had a robust presence in futures and options brokerage services. Their unification as Newedge allowed the firm to offer enhanced financial services with a broader market reach.

In 2014, a significant transition occurred when Société Générale acquired full ownership of Newedge, integrating it into its array of prime services. This acquisition enabled Société Générale to broaden its financial service offerings and consolidate its position in the international brokerage landscape. The integration also signified the strategic alignment of Newedge’s services with Société Générale’s global objectives, enhancing operational efficiencies and client service capabilities.

Newedge’s formation and eventual integration into Société Générale Prime Services exemplify strategic developments aimed at strengthened market positioning. By combining the expertise of Fimat and Calyon Financial, Newedge was able to expand its reach and deepen its expertise across various financial markets.

## Core Financial Services Offered by Newedge

Newedge, a key entity in financial brokerage, was well-regarded for its extensive multi-asset execution and clearing services, a vital component of its core financial offerings. Specializing in listed derivatives, Newedge offered crucial services including futures commission merchant (FCM) operations, prime brokerage, and cross-margining solutions. These services were designed to support institutional clients in managing diverse trading needs efficiently.

The firm prided itself on its expansive market access, providing entry to over 85 global exchanges, which in turn facilitated seamless trading operations for its clients. This reach enabled institutional traders to engage in markets worldwide, thereby optimizing their trading strategies and broadening investment opportunities.

In addition to these capabilities, Newedge offered comprehensive asset finance solutions. These solutions were tailored to address the specific needs of institutional clients, focusing on maximizing asset [liquidity](/wiki/liquidity-risk-premium) and supporting efficient capital utilization. Furthermore, Newedge provided dedicated client portfolio reporting, an essential service that ensured clients could access detailed and accurate information on their portfolio performance. This reporting was structured to aid clients in making informed decisions, aligning their trading activities with broader financial goals.

Overall, Newedge's suite of services was curated to deliver robust, efficient, and comprehensive trading support to some of the most demanding institutional clients in the global financial markets.

## Algorithmic Trading at Newedge

Newedge Institutional Trading Services created a robust electronic trading infrastructure, accommodating various asset classes. The adoption of [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) technologies enabled Newedge to execute trades at optimal prices, ensuring both cost efficiency and speed. Their technology infrastructure was designed to support sophisticated trading strategies across multiple sectors, including equities, fixed income, and mutual funds.

Newedge's approach to algorithmic trading revolved around leveraging advanced computational models and high-speed data analytics. By employing [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning) algorithms and proprietary trading software, Newedge facilitated the determination of optimal trade entry and [exit](/wiki/exit-strategy) points, minimizing market impact and reducing transaction costs. These algorithms were designed to automatically execute trades based on predefined strategies, which could be adjusted in real-time based on market conditions.

The firm's infrastructure supported a seamless transition from basic order handling to complex algorithmic executions. This was achieved through the implementation of high-frequency trading systems, providing rapid price discovery and execution, a crucial [factor](/wiki/factor-investing) in highly competitive markets. Technologies such as co-location services placed their servers in proximity to exchange servers, thus reducing latency and enhancing execution speeds.

In terms of software, Newedge harnessed the power of both traditional programming languages like C++ for system performance and newer languages such as Python for data analysis and algorithm development. Here is an example of a simple Python algorithm that could be adapted for trading purposes:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Example function to generate trading signals based on moving average crossover strategy
def generate_signals(prices, short_window=40, long_window=100):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=prices.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Create short simple moving average
    signals['short_ma'] = prices.rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()

    # Create long simple moving average
    signals['long_ma'] = prices.rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

    # Generate buy signals (1) when short_ma crosses above long_ma
    # Generate sell signals (-1) otherwise
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_ma'][short_window:] > signals['long_ma'][short_window:], 1.0, -1.0)

    return signals
```

This example demonstrates a simple moving average crossover strategy, which can be integrated with more sophisticated logic to suit specific trading models. Such tools and techniques empowered Newedge to handle trades ranging from simple market orders to highly complex algorithmic executions efficiently. This combination of cutting-edge technology and strategic implementation established Newedge as a significant player in the algorithmic trading sector.

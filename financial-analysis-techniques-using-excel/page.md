$$
\text{ROI} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Cost of Investment}} \right) \times 100
$$

NPV is used to analyze the profitability of a projected investment or project, factoring in the time value of money:
$$
\text{NPV} = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{R_t}{(1 + i)^t}
$$
where $R_t$ represents net cash inflow at time $t$, $i$ is the discount rate, and $T$ is the total number of time periods.

IRR is a rate at which the NPV of costs and benefits of a project break even:
It can be found using Excel's IRR function that iteratively calculates the discount rate to make the NPV zero.

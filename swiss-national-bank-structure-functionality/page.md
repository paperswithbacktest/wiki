## What is the Swiss National Bank (SNB)?

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is the central bank of Switzerland. It is responsible for managing the country's money and making sure the economy stays stable. The SNB does this by controlling how much money is in circulation and setting interest rates, which are the costs of borrowing money. It also keeps an eye on the Swiss franc, which is Switzerland's currency, to make sure it stays strong and reliable.

Another important job of the SNB is to help prevent financial crises. It does this by working with other banks and financial institutions to make sure they are safe and sound. The SNB also holds onto Switzerland's gold reserves and other valuable assets. By doing all these things, the SNB helps to keep Switzerland's economy healthy and its money trustworthy.

## When was the Swiss National Bank established?

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) was established on June 16, 1907. Before the SNB was created, Switzerland did not have a central bank. Instead, different banks in the country worked together to manage the money supply and keep the economy stable. But as the economy grew and became more complex, people realized they needed a single, strong bank to take charge.

So, the Swiss government decided to create the SNB. The new bank started working in 1907, and its main job was to control the amount of money in circulation and set interest rates. Over the years, the SNB has played a big role in keeping Switzerland's economy healthy and its currency, the Swiss franc, strong and reliable.

## What are the main objectives of the Swiss National Bank?

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has two main goals. The first goal is to make sure that prices stay stable. This means the SNB tries to keep inflation low, so the cost of things like food and clothes doesn't go up too fast. When prices are stable, people can plan their spending better and the economy works more smoothly. The second goal is to support the overall economic policy of Switzerland. This means the SNB works with the government to help the country's economy grow in a healthy way.

To achieve these goals, the SNB uses different tools. One important tool is setting interest rates. By changing these rates, the SNB can control how much money people and businesses borrow and spend. If the SNB wants to slow down the economy and fight inflation, it might raise interest rates. If it wants to help the economy grow, it might lower them. The SNB also keeps an eye on the Swiss franc to make sure it stays strong and reliable. By doing all these things, the SNB helps keep Switzerland's economy stable and healthy.

## How is the Swiss National Bank structured?

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is run by a group of people called the Governing Board. This board has three members: the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, and one other member. They are in charge of making the big decisions about how to keep the economy stable and prices under control. The Governing Board is helped by the Bank Council, which has 11 members. The Bank Council makes sure the SNB is doing its job well and following the rules.

The SNB also has different departments that handle specific tasks. There are departments for things like money and foreign exchange, financial stability, and research. These departments work together to help the SNB achieve its goals. The SNB has offices in two cities: Zurich and Bern. The Zurich office is the main one, and it's where the Governing Board usually meets. The Bern office helps with some of the SNB's work and is important for connecting with the government.

## Who are the members of the Swiss National Bank's governing board?

The Swiss National Bank's Governing Board has three members. The Chairman is Thomas J. Jordan. He has been in this role since 2012 and is responsible for leading the bank and making sure it meets its goals. The Vice Chairman is Martin Schlegel, who joined the board in 2022. He helps the Chairman and takes over some of his duties when needed. The third member is Antoine Martin, who started working on the board in 2022. He brings his expertise to help make important decisions about the economy.

These three people work together to manage the Swiss National Bank. They set interest rates, control the money supply, and make sure the Swiss franc stays strong. Their job is to keep prices stable and support Switzerland's overall economic policy. They meet regularly to discuss the economy and decide on the best actions to take.

## What role does the Swiss National Bank play in monetary policy?

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) plays a big role in deciding how much money is in Switzerland and how expensive it is to borrow money. This is called monetary policy. The SNB does this by setting interest rates. If they want to slow down the economy and stop prices from going up too fast, they might raise interest rates. This makes borrowing money more expensive, so people and businesses spend less. If they want to help the economy grow, they might lower interest rates. This makes borrowing cheaper, so people and businesses spend more.

The SNB also keeps an eye on the Swiss franc, which is Switzerland's money. They make sure it stays strong and reliable. Sometimes, they buy or sell other countries' money to control the value of the Swiss franc. This helps keep prices stable and supports the overall health of Switzerland's economy. By doing all these things, the SNB helps make sure that the economy works well and that people can trust their money.

## How does the Swiss National Bank manage currency stability?

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) works hard to keep the Swiss franc stable. They do this by watching the value of the Swiss franc compared to other countries' money. If the Swiss franc gets too strong or too weak, the SNB steps in. They might buy or sell other countries' money to change the value of the Swiss franc. This helps keep prices in Switzerland from going up too fast or too slow.

The SNB also uses interest rates to help keep the currency stable. If the Swiss franc is getting too strong, they might lower interest rates. This makes it cheaper for people and businesses to borrow money, so they spend more. This can help weaken the Swiss franc a bit. If the Swiss franc is getting too weak, the SNB might raise interest rates. This makes borrowing more expensive, so people and businesses spend less. This can help strengthen the Swiss franc. By doing these things, the SNB helps keep the Swiss franc stable and reliable.

If they want to slow things down and stop prices from going up too fast, they might raise interest rates to make borrowing more expensive.

Another key job of the SNB is to keep the Swiss franc, which is Switzerland's money, stable and reliable. They do this by watching the value of the Swiss franc compared to other countries' money.

## How does the Swiss National Bank interact with commercial banks?

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) works closely with commercial banks to make sure the money system in Switzerland runs smoothly. One way they do this is by setting interest rates. When the SNB changes these rates, it affects how much it costs for commercial banks to borrow money from the SNB. If the SNB lowers interest rates, it becomes cheaper for commercial banks to borrow, and they might lend more money to people and businesses. If the SNB raises interest rates, borrowing becomes more expensive, and commercial banks might lend less.

The SNB also helps commercial banks by providing them with money when they need it. This is important because it helps prevent banks from running out of money, which could cause big problems. The SNB keeps an eye on how much money commercial banks have and makes sure they are following the rules.

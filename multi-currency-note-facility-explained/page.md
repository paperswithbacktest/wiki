2. **Arbitrage** - Traders use these strategies to exploit price differentials between different markets or securities to make a profit.

3. **Mean Reversion** - This strategy is based on the premise that high and low prices are temporary and a securityâ€™s price will tend to return to its average over time.

4. **Market Making** - Algorithms place buy and sell orders to profit from the bid-ask spread. This strategy requires constant market presence and is widely used by brokers.

5. **Statistical Arbitrage** - Utilizing statistical and econometric techniques, this strategy identifies and exploits relative price movements between instruments that have historically shown statistical interdependency.

The integration of [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning) and [artificial intelligence](/wiki/ai-artificial-intelligence) (AI) in algorithmic trading strategies is a burgeoning trend, allowing for adaptive learning models that can handle large datasets, recognize complex patterns, and make informed predictions.

Python, being a dominant programming language in the finance industry, is frequently used in developing and implementing algorithmic trading strategies. For instance, the following is a simple Python snippet using the `pandas` and `numpy` libraries to calculate a basic moving average crossover strategy:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assume 'data' is a DataFrame containing historical price data
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA_50'][50:] > data['SMA_200'][50:], 1, 0)

# Calculate trading signals: 1 for buy, -1 for sell, and 0 for hold
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Plotting is omitted for simplicity, but visualization often follows strategy development
```

In conclusion, algorithmic trading has reshaped the landscape of modern financial markets by enabling faster, more precise, and less error-prone trade executions. Its growth is underpinned by continuous advancements in computing technology and data analytics, making it an indispensable component of contemporary trading.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data: currency pair returns
data = {'EUR/USD': np.random.randn(100), 'USD/JPY': np.random.randn(100)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = df.corr()

# Example strategy: invest in currency pairs with negative correlation
inverse_correlation_pairs = correlation_matrix[correlation_matrix < 0]

# Simple trading signal based on inverse correlation
signal = inverse_correlation_pairs * np.random.choice([-1, 1], size=inverse_correlation_pairs.shape)

print("Trading signal:\n", signal)
```

This example illustrates a framework where currency pairs with negative correlations could be identified for potential trading strategies, leveraging statistical dependencies to inform decision-making.

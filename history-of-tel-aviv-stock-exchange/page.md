## Historical Background of TASE

The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) has a rich historical background, with its origins tracing back to the 1930s during the period of the British Mandate in Palestine. During this time, informal trading activities commenced with a small group of brokers who laid the groundwork for more structured financial exchanges. Following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, there was a burgeoning need for a formalized financial trading institution. This led to the inception of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 1953, marking its evolution from small-scale trading to a recognized stock exchange.

Over the decades, TASE has witnessed numerous significant developments and transformations. A notable milestone was the introduction of electronic trading systems in 1999, which modernized the exchange and increased trading efficiency and accessibility.

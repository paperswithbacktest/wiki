## How does ISS address environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues?

ISS looks at environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues to help investors make good choices. They check if companies are doing things that are good for the environment, like reducing pollution or using less energy. ISS also looks at how companies treat their workers and the communities around them. This helps investors see if a company is doing the right thing for people and the planet.

When ISS finds out about ESG issues, they tell investors about it in their reports. This can help investors decide if they want to keep their money in the company or take it out. If a company is not doing well on ESG issues, ISS might tell investors to vote for changes at the company's meetings. This way, ISS helps make sure that companies think about more than just making moneyâ€”they also need to be good for the environment and society.

## What are the criticisms and controversies surrounding ISS?

Some people say that ISS has too much power over how companies are run. They think that because so many investors listen to ISS's advice, it can change what happens at company meetings even if the advice isn't always right. Critics also worry that ISS might not always do enough research before giving advice. This could lead to bad decisions by investors who trust ISS too much.

Another big issue is that ISS might have conflicts of interest. This means that ISS might give advice that helps them make more money instead of what is best for investors. For example, ISS also sells services to the companies they give advice about. Some people think this could make ISS less fair in their recommendations. These criticisms show that while ISS helps investors a lot, there are also worries about how fair and accurate their advice really is.

## How does ISS compare to other proxy advisory firms in the market?

ISS is one of the biggest proxy advisory firms, but there are other firms like Glass, Lewis & Co. that do similar work. Both ISS and Glass Lewis help investors decide how to vote at company meetings. They look at how well companies are doing and give advice on things like who should be on the board or how much the CEO should be paid. ISS is known for having a lot of influence because many investors listen to their advice. Glass Lewis is also important, but some people think ISS has more power in the market.

ISS and other firms like Glass Lewis also look at ESG issues, which means they check if companies are good for the environment and society. ISS has a big team that does a lot of research on these things, which helps them give detailed advice to investors. Other firms like Glass Lewis do this too, but they might not have as many resources as ISS. This can make a difference in how much investors trust their advice. Even though ISS is a leader, other firms are always trying to do better and offer different kinds of services to investors.

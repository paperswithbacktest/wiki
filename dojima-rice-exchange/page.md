## What types of rice were traded at the Dojima Rice Exchange?

At the Dojima Rice Exchange, people mainly traded a type of rice called "kome." This rice was very important in Japan because it was used for food and also as a way to pay for things. The rice that was traded at Dojima was usually stored in warehouses, and people would trade promises to get this rice later.

## Who were the main participants in the Dojima Rice Exchange?

The main participants in the Dojima Rice Exchange were farmers, merchants, and brokers. Farmers brought their rice to the exchange to sell it. They wanted to get the best price for their rice, so they would trade it at Dojima. Merchants were also very important because they bought the rice from farmers and sold it to others. They needed the rice to sell in other parts of Japan or to use for their businesses.

Brokers played a key role too. They helped farmers and merchants make deals. Brokers knew a lot about the rice market and helped people agree on prices. They made sure that the trading went smoothly. Sometimes, people who didn't grow or sell rice, like investors, also took part. They traded promises to get rice later, which helped them make money without handling the rice itself.

The idea of trading futures at Dojima helped shape modern financial markets where people trade all sorts of things, not just rice.

## What led to the decline of the Dojima Rice Exchange?

The Dojima Rice Exchange started to decline because of many reasons. One big reason was that Japan's economy changed a lot. In the early 1900s, Japan started to use more modern ways of trading and banking. This meant that rice was not as important for setting prices and trading as it used to be. People started to trade other things like stocks and bonds more often. Also, new rules and laws made it harder for the Dojima Rice Exchange to keep working the way it used to.

Another reason was that the world was changing. Big events like World War II affected Japan's economy a lot. The war made it hard to trade rice and other things. After the war, Japan's focus shifted to rebuilding and using new financial systems. The Dojima Rice Exchange couldn't keep up with these changes. By 1939, it had to close down because it was no longer as useful or important as it once was. Even though it closed, the ideas from the Dojima Rice Exchange helped shape how people trade and use futures contracts today.

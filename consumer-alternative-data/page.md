```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('alternative_data.csv')

# Fill missing values
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# Remove duplicates
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Normalize data
data['normalized_value'] = (data['value'] - data['value'].mean()) / data['value'].std()
```

Ethical considerations also play a crucial role in the use of alternative data. The collection and utilization of personal data raise significant privacy and security concerns. Companies must navigate complex regulatory environments, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to ensure compliance and ethical data handling.

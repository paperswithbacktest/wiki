# Assume df is a DataFrame with columns 'Date', 'Price'
short_window = 40
long_window = 100

signals = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0

signals['short_mavg'] = df['Price'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
signals['long_mavg'] = df['Price'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
```

Beyond technical implementation, understanding algorithm mechanics and market behavior is essential.

## How do primary commodities impact the cost of electronic devices?

Primary commodities like copper, silicon, and rare earth elements are really important for making electronic devices. They are the basic materials that go into making things like smartphones, computers, and TVs. When the prices of these commodities go up, it can make electronic devices more expensive. For example, if the price of copper goes up, the cost of making circuit boards and wires goes up too. This means that the companies making the devices might have to charge more money for them.

The availability of these commodities also matters. If there's not enough of a certain material, like silicon, it can slow down production and make devices more expensive. Sometimes, countries that have a lot of these resources might control how much is available, which can affect prices. So, the cost and availability of primary commodities can have a big impact on how much we pay for our electronic devices.

## What are the environmental impacts of extracting primary commodities for electronics?

Extracting primary commodities for electronics can harm the environment. Mining for metals like copper and gold often involves digging big holes in the ground and using a lot of water and chemicals. This can pollute rivers and lakes, making it hard for plants and animals to live there. Also, the machines used for mining release a lot of carbon dioxide into the air, which adds to climate change.

Another issue is with rare earth elements. These are hard to get and need a lot of processing, which can create toxic waste. This waste can leak into the soil and water, hurting the environment and people's health. For example, mining for neodymium, which is used in magnets, can leave behind radioactive materials that are dangerous.

Overall, the demand for electronics means more mining and processing of these commodities. This can lead to deforestation, loss of habitats, and pollution. It's important for companies and governments to find ways to reduce these impacts and protect the environment while still meeting the need for electronic devices.

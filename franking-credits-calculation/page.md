## What are franking credits?

Franking credits are a type of tax credit that shareholders in Australia can receive when a company pays dividends. When a company makes a profit, it pays tax on that profit. If the company then distributes some of its profits to shareholders as dividends, it can pass on the tax it has already paid to the shareholders. This means shareholders get a credit for the tax the company has paid, which they can use to reduce the tax they owe on their dividend income.

This system is designed to prevent double taxation, where the same income is taxed twice - once at the company level and again at the shareholder level. By allowing shareholders to claim franking credits, the tax system ensures that the income is only taxed once. This can be particularly beneficial for shareholders who are on lower tax rates or who are in a tax loss position, as they may be able to get a refund for the excess franking credits they receive.

## How do franking credits benefit shareholders?

Franking credits help shareholders by reducing the amount of tax they need to pay on their dividends. When a company makes money, it pays tax on that money. If the company then gives some of its profits to shareholders as dividends, it can also give them a credit for the tax it already paid. This credit, called a franking credit, can be used by shareholders to lower their own tax bill on the dividends they receive. This means shareholders don't have to pay tax twice on the same money.

This system is good for shareholders, especially those who pay less tax or don't have to pay tax at all. If a shareholder's tax rate is lower than the company's tax rate, they can use the franking credits to reduce their tax to zero and even get some money back. For example, if a shareholder doesn't owe any tax, they can still claim the franking credits as a refund from the government. This makes franking credits a valuable benefit for many investors.

## What is the difference between franked and unfranked dividends?

Franked dividends are payments from a company to its shareholders that come with a tax credit, called a franking credit. This credit represents the tax the company has already paid on its profits before distributing them as dividends. When shareholders receive franked dividends, they can use these franking credits to reduce the amount of tax they need to pay on the dividend income. This system helps avoid double taxation, where the same money is taxed at both the company and shareholder levels.

Unfranked dividends, on the other hand, are payments from a company to its shareholders without any attached tax credits. This means that the company has not paid tax on the profits it is distributing, or it is distributing profits that were not taxed at the company level. Shareholders receiving unfranked dividends will have to pay tax on the full amount of the dividend they receive, without any reduction from franking credits. This can lead to a higher tax burden for shareholders compared to receiving franked dividends.

## How are franking credits calculated?

Franking credits are calculated based on the amount of tax a company has paid on its profits. When a company makes money, it pays tax on that money at the company tax rate, which is currently 30% for large companies in Australia. If the company decides to give some of its profits back to shareholders as dividends, it can attach a franking credit to those dividends. The franking credit is a portion of the tax the company paid on the profits being distributed. The credit is calculated as the dividend amount multiplied by the company tax rate divided by (1 - the company tax rate). For example, if a company pays a dividend of $70 and the company tax rate is 30%, the franking credit would be $30 ($70 * 0.30 / 0.70).

When shareholders receive these dividends, they include both the dividend and the franking credit in their taxable income. The franking credit offsets the tax the shareholder owes on the dividend. If the shareholder's tax rate is less than the company tax rate, they might end up with excess franking credits. These excess credits can be used to reduce other tax liabilities or, if there are no other taxes owed, can be refunded by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). This system ensures that the profits are only taxed once, either at the company level or the shareholder level, but not both.

## What is the franking account and how does it work?

A franking account is like a special bank account that companies in Australia use to keep track of their franking credits. These credits come from the tax the company has paid on its profits. When a company makes money, it pays tax on it. If the company then gives some of that money back to shareholders as dividends, it can also give them franking credits. The franking account helps the company make sure it has enough credits to attach to the dividends it pays out. It works by recording all the tax the company pays and all the franking credits it gives to shareholders.

When a company pays dividends, it uses the franking credits in its franking account to "frank" those dividends. This means the company adds the credits to the dividends, which shareholders can then use to reduce their own tax bills. The franking account keeps a balance of these credits, and the company can't give out more credits than it has in the account. If the company makes more profit and pays more tax, it adds more credits to the account. If it pays out dividends with franking credits, it takes those credits out of the account. This helps make sure the system is fair and that the tax paid on profits is only counted once.

## What are the tax implications of franking credits for individuals?

When you get dividends from a company that has paid tax on its profits, you also get franking credits. These credits can help lower the tax you owe on the dividends. If you're in a lower tax bracket than the company, the franking credits might be more than the tax you owe. In this case, you can get the extra credits back as a refund from the tax office. This means you don't pay tax twice on the same money, once at the company level and again when you get the dividends.

If you don't owe any tax at all, like if you're retired or have low income, you can still claim the franking credits as a refund. This can be a big help because it gives you extra money back. But if you're in a higher tax bracket than the company, you'll still have to pay some tax on the dividends, even with the franking credits. The credits just make sure you only pay tax on the money once, either when the company pays tax or when you get the dividends.

## How do companies determine the franking percentage of their dividends?

When companies decide to pay dividends, they also choose how much of the tax they paid on their profits to give to shareholders as franking credits. The franking percentage shows how much of the tax paid by the company is passed on to shareholders. It can be anywhere from 0% to 100%. If a company gives 100% franking, it means all the tax it paid on the profits it's sharing is given to shareholders as credits. If it's less than 100%, like 75% or 50%, then only part of the tax is passed on.

The franking percentage is important because it affects how much tax shareholders have to pay on their dividends. If a company decides on a high franking percentage, shareholders get more credits and might pay less tax or even get a refund. If the percentage is low, shareholders get fewer credits and might have to pay more tax. Companies decide on the franking percentage based on their tax situation and how much profit they want to share with shareholders.

## Can franking credits be refunded, and under what conditions?

Yes, franking credits can be refunded if you have more credits than the tax you owe. When a company pays you dividends and gives you franking credits, you add both to your income. If the franking credits are more than the tax you need to pay on that income, you can get the extra credits back as a refund from the tax office. This is good for people who don't owe much tax or no tax at all, like retirees or those with low incomes.

The main condition for getting a refund is that your franking credits must be more than the tax you owe. If you're in a lower tax bracket than the company, or if you don't have to pay any tax, you can claim the extra credits. This makes sure you don't pay tax twice on the same money, once when the company pays tax on its profits and again when you get the dividends.

## What are the rules regarding the carry forward of franking credits?

If a company has more franking credits than it can use in a year, it can [carry](/wiki/carry-trading) them forward to use in future years. This means if a company doesn't pay out all its profits as dividends in one year, it can save the unused franking credits and attach them to dividends in later years. This helps the company make sure it uses all the tax credits it has earned from paying tax on its profits.

For shareholders, if they have more franking credits than they need to reduce their tax bill in a year, they can also carry them forward. This is useful if they don't owe much tax one year but might owe more in future years. They can use the extra credits to lower their tax bill later on, making sure they don't lose out on the benefits of the credits they received.

## How do international shareholders utilize franking credits?

International shareholders can use franking credits, but there are some rules they need to follow. If they live in a country that has a tax treaty with Australia, they might be able to use the franking credits to lower the tax they pay on their dividends. They need to check the rules of the treaty to see if they can claim the credits and how to do it. If there's no tax treaty, they usually can't use the franking credits to reduce their tax in their home country.

Some international shareholders might be able to claim a refund of franking credits from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) if they meet certain conditions. They need to be residents of a country that has a tax treaty with Australia that allows for these refunds. They also need to fill out the right forms and follow the ATO's rules. This can be a bit complicated, so it's a good idea for international shareholders to talk to a tax expert to make sure they do everything correctly.

## What are the potential impacts of franking credits on investment decisions?

Franking credits can have a big impact on how people decide to invest their money. If someone is thinking about buying shares in a company, they might look at whether the company pays franked dividends. This is because franking credits can help lower the tax they have to pay on the dividends they receive. For people who don't owe much tax or no tax at all, like retirees, franking credits can even give them extra money back as a refund. This makes shares that come with franking credits more attractive to these investors.

On the other hand, investors who are in higher tax brackets might not care as much about franking credits. They might still have to pay some tax on their dividends, even with the credits. But for everyone, knowing about franking credits can help them choose which companies to invest in. They might decide to put their money into companies that offer franked dividends to get the tax benefits, which can make a big difference in how much money they keep after taxes.

## How have recent changes in tax laws affected the use of franking credits?

Recent changes in tax laws in Australia have had a big impact on how people use franking credits. One big change was a proposal to stop people from getting refunds on franking credits if they didn't owe any tax. This was called the "franking credit refund policy." If it had gone through, it would have meant that people like retirees, who often get refunds because they don't owe tax, would no longer get that extra money back. But after a lot of people spoke out against it, the government decided not to go ahead with the change. So, people can still get refunds on their franking credits if they have more credits than the tax they owe.

Another change that has affected franking credits is the company tax rate. The government lowered the tax rate for small and medium-sized companies from 30% to 25%. This means that when these companies pay dividends, the franking credits attached to them are based on the lower tax rate. This can change how much tax shareholders have to pay on their dividends. For shareholders in lower tax brackets, this might mean they get less of a refund or tax benefit from franking credits than before. These changes show how tax laws can change the way people think about and use franking credits when making investment decisions.

## How does tax calculation involving franking credits work?

Franking credits play a vital role in the tax calculation process for dividends, mitigating the issue of double taxation. These credits are primarily applicable within the Australian tax system and serve a significant purpose in aligning the corporate and personal tax obligations of shareholders. Understanding the calculation process of tax payable when franking credits are involved can greatly influence one's investment strategy.

### Calculation of Franking Credits

Franking credits represent the tax already paid by a company on its profits, which is subsequently distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends. To determine the franking credits associated with a dividend, one needs to know the corporate tax rate and the franking percentage. The franking credit is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Franking Credit} = \frac{\text{Dividend} \times \text{Franking Percentage}}{1 - \text{Corporate Tax Rate}}
$$

For instance, suppose a company pays a fully franked dividend of AUD 1,000 and the corporate tax rate is 30%. The franking percentage in this case is 100%. The franking credit would be:

$$
\text{Franking Credit} = \frac{1,000 \times 100\%}{1 - 0.30} = 428.57
$$

Thus, the total assessable income from the dividend for tax purposes will be AUD 1,428.57.

### Impact on Taxable Income and Refund Potential

The franking credits are added to the dividend amount to calculate the grossed-up taxable income. This total forms part of the investor’s assessable income and is taxed at their marginal tax rate. If the shareholder’s tax liability is less than the franking credits received, they might be eligible for a tax refund for the difference.

For example, if an investor’s tax liability on the dividend is AUD 300, they would be entitled to a refund of:

$$
\text{Refund} = \text{Franking Credit} - \text{Tax Liability} = 428.57 - 300 = 128.57
$$

### Common Challenges and Misconceptions

A prevalent challenge in calculating taxes involving franking credits is accurately accounting for the grossed-up taxable income. Investors may mistakenly believe that the dividend amount alone reflects their taxable income, leading to miscalculations of their tax obligations.

Another common misconception is that franking credits automatically result in tax refunds. However, the receipt of refunds depends on the individual taxpayer’s circumstances, such as their marginal tax rate and other taxable income.

Complexity also arises when dealing with partially franked or unfranked dividends, which requires careful consideration and adjustment of calculations. Investors must remain vigilant to the specifics of each dividend and consult tax professionals if necessary to ensure compliance and optimization of their tax positions.

By navigating these aspects with precision, investors can make well-informed decisions that leverage franking credits to potentially enhance their investment returns.

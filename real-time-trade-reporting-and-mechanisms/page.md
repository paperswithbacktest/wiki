import numpy as np

# Simulating real-time data ingestion
price_data = np.random.rand(100)  # Randomly generated data representing market prices
price_series = pd.Series(price_data, name='Price')

# Simple algorithmic strategy: Moving Average Crossover
short_window = 10
long_window = 30

signals = pd.DataFrame(index=price_series.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0
signals['short_mavg'] = price_series.rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
signals['long_mavg'] = price_series.rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Create trading signals based on moving average crossover
signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
```

This example demonstrates how real-time price data can be used in a moving average crossover strategy to generate buy and sell signals. By continuously updating with live data, the algorithm can dynamically adjust its position based on market conditions.

In conclusion, algorithmic trading represents a significant leap forward in trading efficiency and effectiveness. Its evolution and the integration of real-time data have transformed how financial markets operate, providing traders with sophisticated tools to navigate complex market environments.

## What is Venmo and how does its debit card work?

Venmo is an app that lets you send and receive money easily from your phone. You can use it to pay friends back for things like dinners or rent. It's like a digital wallet where you can keep money and transfer it to other people who also use Venmo. To start using Venmo, you need to download the app, create an account, and link it to your bank account or a debit/credit card.

The Venmo debit card is a special card that you can get if you use Venmo. It's connected to your Venmo account, so you can spend the money in your Venmo account directly, just like you would with a regular debit card. You can use it to buy things in stores or online, and the money comes out of your Venmo balance. It's handy because you don't need to move money to your bank account first; you can spend it right away from your Venmo account.

## How does PayPal relate to Venmo?

PayPal and Venmo are both owned by the same company, so they work together but are different apps.

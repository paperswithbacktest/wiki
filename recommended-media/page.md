from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample dataset
data = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv')
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2']]
y = data['target']

# Splitting data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model creation and training
model = LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)

# Model prediction
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

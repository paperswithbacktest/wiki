## What is a menstrual cycle?

A menstrual cycle is the monthly process that happens in a woman's body to prepare for a possible pregnancy. It starts on the first day of a woman's period and usually lasts about 28 days, but it can be shorter or longer. During this time, the body goes through changes controlled by hormones. These changes help an egg to grow and be released from the ovary, a process called ovulation. If the egg is not fertilized by sperm, the lining of the uterus, which has been getting ready to support a pregnancy, is shed during the period.

The menstrual cycle has different phases. The first phase is the menstrual phase, which is when a woman has her period. This lasts about 3 to 7 days. After that comes the follicular phase, where the body prepares an egg for release. This phase ends with ovulation, when the egg is released from the ovary. The last phase is the luteal phase, where the body gets ready for a possible pregnancy. If pregnancy doesn't happen, the cycle starts over again with the menstrual phase. Understanding the menstrual cycle can help women know their bodies better and take care of their health.

## How long is a typical menstrual cycle?

A typical menstrual cycle lasts about 28 days. But, it can be shorter or longer. Some women have cycles that are 21 days, and others might have cycles that are 35 days. It's normal for the length of the cycle to change a bit from month to month.

The menstrual cycle starts on the first day of a woman's period. This is when the body sheds the lining of the uterus. After the period, the body starts to prepare for a possible pregnancy. If a pregnancy doesn't happen, the cycle starts over again with the next period.

## What are the phases of a menstrual cycle?

The menstrual cycle has four main phases. The first phase is called the menstrual phase. This is when a woman has her period. It starts on the first day of bleeding and lasts about 3 to 7 days. During this time, the body sheds the lining of the uterus because a pregnancy did not happen.

After the menstrual phase comes the follicular phase. This phase starts at the same time as the menstrual phase but continues until ovulation. During the follicular phase, the body starts to prepare an egg for release. Hormones help the egg to grow inside a follicle in the ovary. This phase ends when the egg is released, which is called ovulation.

The third phase is the luteal phase. It starts right after ovulation and lasts about 14 days. During this time, the body gets ready for a possible pregnancy. If the egg is not fertilized by sperm, the body will start the menstrual phase again, and the cycle will repeat. If the egg is fertilized, it can lead to pregnancy.

## What happens during the follicular phase?

During the follicular phase, the body starts to get ready for a possible pregnancy. This phase begins on the first day of a woman's period and lasts until an egg is released from the ovary, which is called ovulation. In this phase, the brain sends signals to the ovaries to start growing eggs. These eggs grow inside little sacs called follicles. Usually, one follicle becomes the biggest and strongest, and it gets ready to release its egg.

Hormones play a big role during the follicular phase. The hormone FSH, or follicle-stimulating hormone, helps the follicles grow. Another hormone, estrogen, starts to increase as the follicles grow. Estrogen helps the lining of the uterus to get thicker and ready for a possible pregnancy. When the estrogen levels get high enough, it triggers a surge of another hormone called LH, or luteinizing hormone. This LH surge is what causes ovulation, marking the end of the follicular phase.

## What is ovulation and when does it occur?

Ovulation is when an egg is released from the ovary. It's a key part of the menstrual cycle and happens about halfway through the cycle. For a woman with a 28-day cycle, ovulation usually happens around day 14. But, it can vary because not all women have a 28-day cycle.

The egg that's released during ovulation is ready to be fertilized by sperm. If sperm reaches the egg, it can lead to pregnancy. If the egg isn't fertilized, it will break down and be shed during the next period. Ovulation is triggered by a surge in the hormone LH, or luteinizing hormone. This surge happens at the end of the follicular phase, right before ovulation.

## What changes occur during the luteal phase?

During the luteal phase, the body gets ready for a possible pregnancy. This phase starts right after ovulation and lasts about 14 days. After the egg is released, the empty follicle in the ovary turns into something called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum makes a hormone called progesterone. Progesterone helps the lining of the uterus get thicker and ready for a fertilized egg to implant. If the egg gets fertilized by sperm, it can attach to the uterus and start a pregnancy.

If the egg isn't fertilized, the corpus luteum will break down, and the levels of progesterone will drop. This drop in progesterone causes the lining of the uterus to start to break down. This leads to the start of the menstrual phase, and the cycle begins all over again with a new period. During the luteal phase, some women might notice changes like mood swings, bloating, or breast tenderness. These are normal and part of the body's response to the hormonal changes happening.

## How do successive menstrual cycles relate to each other?

Successive menstrual cycles are like a repeating pattern in a woman's body. Each cycle starts with the menstrual phase, which is when a woman has her period. This happens because the body didn't get pregnant in the last cycle, so it sheds the lining of the uterus. After the period, the body starts the follicular phase, where it gets ready for a new possible pregnancy. This phase ends with ovulation, when an egg is released from the ovary. If the egg isn't fertilized, the cycle moves into the luteal phase, where the body prepares for pregnancy again. If no pregnancy happens, the cycle ends and a new one begins with another period.

Each new cycle is connected to the one before it because they follow the same steps but start over again. The length of each cycle can be a bit different, but the phases happen in the same order. The hormones that control the cycle, like estrogen and progesterone, go up and down in a pattern that repeats with each new cycle. This pattern helps the body know when to start a new cycle and when to try for a pregnancy again. So, even though each cycle is separate, they are all part of the same ongoing process in a woman's body.

## What are common variations in menstrual cycle length?

A typical menstrual cycle lasts about 28 days, but it can be shorter or longer. Some women have cycles that last 21 days, while others might have cycles that last 35 days or even longer. It's normal for the length of the cycle to change a bit from month to month. This can happen because of things like stress, changes in weight, travel, or illness.

The length of the menstrual cycle can also change as a woman gets older. When a girl first starts getting her period, her cycles might be irregular for a while. As she gets older, her cycles usually become more regular. But, as a woman gets closer to menopause, her cycles might start to change again and become irregular. It's important for women to know what is normal for their own bodies and to talk to a doctor if they have concerns about their menstrual cycle.

## How can tracking successive menstrual cycles help with fertility?

Tracking successive menstrual cycles can help a woman know when she is most likely to get pregnant. This is because it helps her find out when she ovulates. Ovulation is when an egg is released from the ovary and is ready to be fertilized by sperm. By keeping track of her cycles, a woman can see patterns and predict when ovulation will happen. This can help her and her partner plan to have sex during the most fertile time of the month, which increases the chances of getting pregnant.

Using tools like a calendar, an app, or even just noting down the start and end of each period can make tracking easier. Some women also use other signs like changes in their body temperature or the texture of their cervical mucus to help pinpoint ovulation. By understanding these patterns over several cycles, a woman can better time her efforts to conceive. This can make the journey to pregnancy more successful and less stressful.

## What hormonal changes drive the menstrual cycle?

The menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones that go up and down throughout the cycle. The main hormones are FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), estrogen, and progesterone. At the start of the cycle, FSH levels rise. This tells the ovaries to start growing eggs inside little sacs called follicles. As the follicles grow, they make more estrogen. Estrogen helps the lining of the uterus get thicker and ready for a possible pregnancy. When estrogen levels get high enough, it triggers a big increase in LH, which causes ovulation. This is when the egg is released from the ovary.

After ovulation, the empty follicle turns into something called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum makes progesterone. Progesterone keeps the lining of the uterus thick and ready for a fertilized egg to attach. If the egg gets fertilized, it can lead to pregnancy. If not, the corpus luteum breaks down, and progesterone levels drop. This drop in progesterone causes the lining of the uterus to break down and start the period. Then, the cycle starts all over again with new rising levels of FSH.

## How do external factors like stress or diet affect successive menstrual cycles?

External factors like stress or diet can change how long a woman's menstrual cycle lasts and how regular it is. Stress can mess with the hormones that control the cycle. When someone is stressed, their body might make more of a hormone called cortisol. This can make the levels of other hormones like estrogen and progesterone go down. When these hormone levels change, it can make the cycle longer or shorter, or even stop it for a while. Diet can also affect the cycle. If a woman doesn't eat enough or loses a lot of weight quickly, her body might not make enough hormones to keep the cycle going normally. Eating a lot of junk food or not getting enough nutrients can also throw off the balance of hormones.

These changes can make it hard to predict when a period will come or when ovulation will happen. For women trying to get pregnant, this can make it harder to know the best time to try. For others, it might mean dealing with unexpected periods or longer times between periods. Keeping stress low and eating a balanced diet can help keep the menstrual cycle more regular. If a woman notices big changes in her cycle because of stress or diet, talking to a doctor can help her figure out what to do next.

## What are some medical conditions that can disrupt the regularity of successive menstrual cycles?

Some medical conditions can make a woman's menstrual cycle not come at the same time every month. One common condition is polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS. With PCOS, the body makes too much of a hormone called androgen, which can stop ovulation from happening regularly. This can make periods come less often or not at all. Another condition is thyroid disease. The thyroid is a gland that helps control the body's metabolism, and if it's not working right, it can mess with the hormones that control the menstrual cycle. This can make periods come too often, too far apart, or not at all.

Other conditions that can affect the menstrual cycle include uterine fibroids and endometriosis. Uterine fibroids are growths in the uterus that can make periods heavier and longer. Endometriosis is when tissue like the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, which can cause pain and heavy bleeding. Eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia can also disrupt the cycle because they can make the body not produce enough hormones to keep the cycle regular. If a woman notices big changes in her menstrual cycle, it's a good idea to talk to a doctor to find out if a medical condition might be the cause.

IG Group Holdings plc adopts a transparent and comprehensive fee structure, making it accessible to both novice and seasoned traders. One key component of this structure is the spread costs, which represent the difference between the bid and ask price of a financial instrument. These costs vary depending on the asset class, with forex spreads starting from as low as 0.6 pips for major currency pairs. 

In addition to spread costs, IG imposes overnight financing fees on leveraged positions. These fees are calculated based on the market value of the position and the duration it is held overnight. The formula to calculate the overnight financing cost is as follows:

$$
\text{Financing Cost} = \text{Notional Volume} \times \text{Daily Interest Rate}
$$

where the daily interest rate is derived from the prevailing benchmark interest rate, with an additional small percentage for IG's margin.

The inactivity fee is another consideration for traders who do not engage in trading activities over extended periods. IG charges a monthly fee of £12 (or equivalent in other currencies) on dormant accounts after two years of inactivity. This fee ensures that resources are utilized efficiently across active clients.

For active traders, IG offers discounts and special pricing programs designed to reduce trading costs. These programs are typically based on trading [volume](/wiki/volume-trading-strategy), offering rebates or lower spreads as users increase their trading frequency. While specific discounts may vary, they are generally tailored to incentivize higher trading volumes.

Notably, IG does not charge fees for account opening, which allows traders to initiate their trading activities without any initial financial burden. Similarly, there are no fees for deposits or withdrawals via the standard methods provided by IG, ensuring that clients can manage their funds efficiently without incurring additional costs.

In summary, IG's fee structure is designed to be competitive and straightforward, facilitating a cost-effective trading environment. The absence of account opening, deposit, and withdrawal fees further enhances IG's attractiveness, offering traders a reputable platform with transparent pricing practices.

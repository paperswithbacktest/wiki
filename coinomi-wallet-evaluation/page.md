## What are the fees associated with using Coinomi Wallet?

When you use Coinomi Wallet, you don't have to pay any fees to Coinomi itself. The wallet is free to download and use. However, when you send cryptocurrencies, you might have to pay a small fee to the network that handles the transaction. This fee is called a "network fee" or "transaction fee," and it goes to the miners or validators who process your transaction on the blockchain.

The amount of the network fee depends on the cryptocurrency you're sending and how busy the network is. For example, sending Bitcoin might cost more than sending a less popular cryptocurrency. You can choose how much you want to pay for the fee, but if you pay less, your transaction might take longer to go through. Coinomi lets you set this fee, so you can decide if you want your transaction to be faster or cheaper.

## Can you use Coinomi Wallet across multiple devices, and how?

Once you have your recovery phrase, you can download Coinomi on another device, like your phone or computer, and choose the option to "Restore Wallet" when you open the app. Enter your recovery phrase in the correct order, and your wallet will be set up on the new device with all your cryptocurrencies.

Using Coinomi on multiple devices is handy because you can access your wallet from anywhere. Just make sure to keep your recovery phrase safe and never share it with anyone. If you lose your recovery phrase, you won't be able to get your money back. Also, remember that each device you use should be secure to keep your cryptocurrencies safe.

If you need to recover your wallet, you can use this recovery phrase. Just download Coinomi on a new device, choose the "Restore Wallet" option, and enter your recovery phrase in the correct order. Once you do this, your wallet will be set up on the new device with all your cryptocurrencies. This makes it easy to use Coinomi on different devices or recover your wallet if something goes wrong.

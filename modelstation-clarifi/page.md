    data.dropna(inplace=True)
    # Remove duplicates
    data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
    return data

def validate_data(data):
    # Ensure no negative values in price column
    assert (data['price'] >= 0).all(), "Negative prices found"
    return True

# Example usage
data = pd.read_csv('trading_data.csv')
cleaned_data = clean_data(data)
if validate_data(cleaned_data):
    print("Data is valid and ready for use.")
```

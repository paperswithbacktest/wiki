Consider a common [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) task: calculating moving averages over large datasets. Through CUDA, a Python implementation of this task might involve utilizing libraries such as Numba, which allows Python functions to be compiled to run on the GPU:

```python
from numba import cuda
import numpy as np

@cuda.jit
def moving_average_gpu(prices, window, output):
    idx = cuda.grid(1)
    if idx < prices.size - window:
        temp_sum = 0
        for i in range(window):
            temp_sum += prices[idx + i]
        output[idx] = temp_sum / window

# Example usage
prices = np.random.rand(1000000).astype(np.float32)
window_size = 50
output = np.zeros(prices.size - window_size, dtype=np.float32)

threads_per_block = 512
blocks = (output.size + (threads_per_block - 1)) // threads_per_block
moving_average_gpu[blocks, threads_per_block](prices, window_size, output)
```

In this code, the function `moving_average_gpu` computes the moving average of stock prices using windowed segments of the data. By executing this function on a GPU, the computation time is drastically reduced compared to processing on a conventional CPU.

        for j in range(window_size):
            acc_sum += data[i + j]
        result[i] = acc_sum / window_size

data = np.random.rand(10000)  # Example data
window_size = 5
result = np.zeros(len(data) - window_size + 1)

# Launch kernel
threads_per_block = 256
blocks_per_grid = (len(result) + (threads_per_block - 1)) // threads_per_block
moving_average_cuda[blocks_per_grid, threads_per_block](data, window_size, result)
```

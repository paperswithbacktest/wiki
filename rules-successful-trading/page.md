Trend following strategies focus on identifying and riding existing market trends without attempting to predict specific market directions. This approach uses various indicators, such as moving averages, to identify upward or downward trends that are statistically likely to continue. By reacting to movements rather than predicting them, trend followers can capitalize on sustained price directions.

Arbitrage takes advantage of price discrepancies of the same asset across different markets or forms. A common form is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to profit from price differentials. For example, if a stock is priced lower on one exchange than another, a trader can buy low and sell high, capturing the price difference as profit. This strategy often requires precise execution and speed, attributes that algorithmic systems provide efficiently.

Market making involves continuously quoting buy and sell prices for financial instruments and profiting from the bid-ask spread. Market makers provide [liquidity](/wiki/liquidity-risk-premium) to the markets, making it easier for other participants to execute trades. Algorithms in this strategy adjust orders dynamically based on market conditions, maintaining a balance between supply and demand.

Statistical arbitrage leverages statistical and econometric techniques to identify pricing inefficiencies between related financial instruments. Common methods include [pair trading](/wiki/pair-trading), where a trader identifies two historically correlated securities and takes offsetting positions when their price relationship diverges, expecting reversion to historical norms. This requires robust statistical analysis and rapid execution.

Machine learning models bring a data-driven approach by utilizing historical and real-time data to uncover patterns and make predictions about future price movements. By training machine learning algorithms on large datasets, traders can develop predictive models that adapt to new information and evolving market conditions.

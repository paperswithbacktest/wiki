## What is the Bundesbank?

The Bundesbank is the central bank of Germany. It is like a big bank that helps control the money in the country. The Bundesbank works to make sure the money in Germany is stable and that prices don't go up too fast. This is important because it helps people and businesses plan for the future.

The Bundesbank is also part of the European Central Bank system. This means it works with other countries in Europe to manage their money together. Even though it is part of a bigger group, the Bundesbank still has important jobs to do in Germany, like making sure banks in the country are safe and follow the rules.

## When was the Bundesbank established?

The Bundesbank was established on July 1, 1957. This was an important time because Germany was rebuilding after World War II and needed a strong bank to help manage its money.

Before the Bundesbank, Germany had different banks in different parts of the country. By creating the Bundesbank, Germany made one big bank to help the whole country. This helped Germany's economy grow and become stable.

## What is the primary function of the Bundesbank?

The main job of the Bundesbank is to keep the money in Germany stable. This means they try to stop prices from going up too fast, which is called inflation. When prices stay steady, it's easier for people and businesses to plan for the future. The Bundesbank does this by controlling how much money is in the economy and setting interest rates, which is the cost of borrowing money.

Another important job of the Bundesbank is to make sure that banks in Germany are safe and follow the rules. They check on banks to make sure they are not taking too many risks and that they have enough money to pay back people who put their money in the bank.

Below the Central Office, there are nine Regional Offices spread out across Germany. Each Regional Office looks after banks and businesses in its area. They help make sure that the rules set by the Central Office are followed everywhere in Germany. The Regional Offices also collect information about what's happening in their part of the country and send it back to the Central Office. This helps the Bundesbank understand what's going on all over Germany and make good decisions.

The Bundesbank also has a big group called the Directorate, which helps the President run the bank. The Directorate includes the President, the Vice-President, and other important leaders. They meet regularly to talk about big issues and decide what the Bundesbank should do next. This way, the Bundesbank can work together to keep Germany's money stable and its banks safe.

## What are mutual fund C shares?

Mutual fund C shares are a type of mutual fund share class that often come with different fee structures compared to other share classes like A or B shares. C shares typically do not have a front-end sales charge, which means you don't pay a fee when you buy them. However, they usually have a higher annual operating expense ratio and may include a back-end sales charge, also known as a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), if you sell the shares within a certain period, usually one year.

The higher annual fees of C shares can make them less cost-effective for long-term investors. For example, if you plan to hold onto your mutual fund for many years, the ongoing higher expenses could add up and eat into your returns. On the other hand, C shares might be a good choice if you want to invest a smaller amount of money without paying an upfront fee and you don't plan to keep the investment for a long time. It's important to consider your investment goals and how long you plan to stay invested when deciding if C shares are right for you.

## What are mutual fund A shares?

Mutual fund A shares are a type of mutual fund share class that you can buy. When you buy A shares, you usually have to pay a fee right away. This fee is called a front-end sales charge or load. The fee is a percentage of the amount you invest, and it can be as high as 5.75% for some funds. The good thing about A shares is that they often have lower yearly fees than other types of shares. This can make them a better choice if you plan to keep your money in the fund for a long time.

A shares might also offer you something called breakpoints. Breakpoints are discounts on the front-end sales charge that you can get if you invest a larger amount of money. For example, if you invest more than a certain amount, like $50,000, you might pay a lower sales charge. This can make A shares more attractive for people who have more money to invest at once. So, if you're thinking about buying A shares, it's important to look at how much you're investing and how long you plan to keep your money in the fund.

## What are mutual fund B shares?

Mutual fund B shares are another type of share class that you can buy. These shares don't make you pay a fee when you buy them, which is good if you don't want to pay money upfront. But, if you decide to sell your B shares within a certain time, like a few years, you might have to pay a fee called a back-end sales charge or a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). This fee usually goes down the longer you keep your money in the fund, and it might even go away completely after a set time, like six years.

B shares often have higher yearly fees than A shares but lower than C shares. This means that if you plan to keep your money in the fund for a medium amount of time, B shares might be a good choice. But, it's important to think about how long you want to keep your money in the fund. If you plan to keep it for a long time, the higher yearly fees might add up and make B shares less good for you than A shares. So, always think about your goals and how long you'll invest before choosing B shares.

## How do the sales charges differ between A, B, and C shares?

A shares have a front-end sales charge, which means you pay a fee when you buy them. This fee can be as high as 5.75% of what you invest. But, A shares usually have lower yearly fees, so they can be good if you plan to keep your money in the fund for a long time. A shares also offer breakpoints, which are discounts on the front-end sales charge if you invest a bigger amount of money.

B shares don't make you pay a fee when you buy them, but if you sell them within a certain time, you might have to pay a back-end sales charge or CDSC. This fee goes down the longer you keep your money in the fund and might go away completely after a few years. B shares have higher yearly fees than A shares but lower than C shares, so they can be a good choice if you plan to keep your money in the fund for a medium amount of time.

C shares also don't have a front-end sales charge, so you don't pay a fee when you buy them. But, if you sell them within a short time, like a year, you might have to pay a back-end sales charge. C shares have the highest yearly fees of the three share classes, which can make them less good for long-term investments. They can be a good choice if you want to invest a smaller amount of money and don't plan to keep it in the fund for a long time.

## What are the typical expense ratios for A, B, and C shares?

A shares usually have the lowest yearly fees out of the three share classes. The expense ratio for A shares can be around 0.5% to 1.5%. This lower fee is good if you plan to keep your money in the fund for a long time because it means you pay less every year to keep your investment.

B shares have higher yearly fees than A shares but lower than C shares. Their expense ratio is often between 1% and 2%. B shares can be a good choice if you plan to keep your money in the fund for a medium amount of time because the yearly fees are not as high as C shares but higher than A shares.

C shares have the highest yearly fees of the three share classes. Their expense ratio can be around 1.5% to 2.5%. This higher fee makes C shares less good for long-term investments, but they can be a good choice if you want to invest a smaller amount of money and don't plan to keep it in the fund for a long time.

## How do the holding periods affect the costs of A, B, and C shares?

The holding period, or how long you keep your money in the fund, affects the costs of A, B, and C shares in different ways. For A shares, you pay a fee when you buy them, but they have lower yearly fees. If you plan to keep your money in the fund for a long time, like more than 5 years, A shares can be a good choice because the lower yearly fees save you money over time. But if you sell your A shares soon after buying them, you might lose money because of the big fee you paid at the start.

For B shares, you don't pay a fee when you buy them, but you might have to pay a fee if you sell them within a few years. This fee goes down the longer you keep your money in the fund and might go away completely after a few years. B shares have higher yearly fees than A shares but lower than C shares. So, if you plan to keep your money in the fund for a medium amount of time, like 3 to 7 years, B shares might be a good choice because the yearly fees are not too high, and the fee for selling goes away after a while.

C shares also don't make you pay a fee when you buy them, but you might have to pay a fee if you sell them within a short time, like a year. C shares have the highest yearly fees of the three share classes. If you plan to keep your money in the fund for a short time, C shares can be a good choice because you don't pay a fee at the start. But if you keep your money in the fund for a long time, the high yearly fees can add up and make C shares more expensive than A or B shares.

## What are the conversion features of B and C shares?

B shares often have a feature called conversion. This means that after you keep your money in the fund for a certain time, like 6 to 8 years, your B shares can automatically change into A shares. This is good because A shares usually have lower yearly fees. So, if you plan to keep your money in the fund for a long time, B shares can start out with no fee when you buy them and then turn into A shares with lower fees later on.

C shares also have a conversion feature, but it works a bit differently. After you've held your C shares for a certain time, like 8 to 10 years, they might change into a different class of shares with lower yearly fees. This can help you save money if you keep your investment for a long time. But, because C shares start with the highest yearly fees, it's important to think about how long you'll keep your money in the fund before choosing them.

## How does the 12b-1 fee impact A, B, and C shares?

The 12b-1 fee is a yearly fee that some mutual funds charge to cover the costs of marketing and selling the fund. For A shares, the 12b-1 fee is usually the lowest of the three share classes, often around 0.25% or less. This is because A shares already charge a big fee when you buy them, so they don't need to charge as much every year to cover marketing costs. If you plan to keep your money in the fund for a long time, the low 12b-1 fee helps keep your yearly costs down.

For B and C shares, the 12b-1 fee is usually higher than for A shares. B shares might have a 12b-1 fee around 1%, and C shares might have a fee around 1% or even higher. This is because B and C shares don't charge a big fee when you buy them, so they need to charge more every year to cover marketing and selling costs. If you plan to keep your money in the fund for a short or medium time, the higher 12b-1 fee can make B and C shares more expensive than A shares over time.

## What are the tax implications of choosing A, B, or C shares?

When you choose A, B, or C shares, the tax implications can be different because of how the fees and holding periods work. For A shares, you pay a big fee when you buy them, which you can't take off your taxes right away. But, if you sell your A shares and make a profit, you'll have to pay taxes on that profit. If you keep your A shares for more than a year before selling, you might pay a lower tax rate on your profit because it's considered a long-term capital gain.

For B and C shares, you don't pay a fee when you buy them, but you might have to pay a fee if you sell them soon. If you sell B or C shares and make a profit, you'll have to pay taxes on that profit just like with A shares. The yearly fees for B and C shares are higher, and you can't take these fees off your taxes right away either. But if you keep B or C shares for a long time, they might turn into a different class of shares with lower fees, which could help your investment grow more and affect how much tax you pay when you sell.

## How do A, B, and C shares perform over different investment horizons?

Over short investment horizons, like less than a year, C shares might be the best choice because you don't pay a fee when you buy them. But, if you sell C shares within a year, you might have to pay a small fee. C shares have the highest yearly fees, so if you keep them for a short time, the fees won't add up as much. B shares could also be good for short periods because you don't pay a fee when you buy them, but the yearly fees are higher than A shares. A shares might not be the best for short periods because of the big fee you pay when you buy them, which can eat into your returns if you sell soon after buying.

For medium investment horizons, like 3 to 7 years, B shares might be a good choice. You don't pay a fee when you buy them, and the fee for selling goes down the longer you keep your money in the fund. After a few years, the fee for selling might go away completely, and B shares might turn into A shares with lower yearly fees. A shares can also be good for medium periods if you invest a big amount of money because you might get a discount on the fee you pay when you buy them. C shares might not be the best for medium periods because their high yearly fees can add up and make them more expensive than A or B shares.

Over long investment horizons, like more than 7 years, A shares are often the best choice because they have the lowest yearly fees. Even though you pay a big fee when you buy A shares, the lower yearly fees save you money over time. B shares can also be good for long periods because they might turn into A shares after a few years, which means you start with no fee when you buy them and then get the lower yearly fees of A shares. C shares might not be the best for long periods because their high yearly fees can add up and make them more expensive than A or B shares.

## What are the strategic considerations for choosing between A, B, and C shares based on investment goals?

When choosing between A, B, and C shares, think about what you want to achieve with your investment. If you're looking to invest for a short time, like less than a year, C shares might be the best choice. You don't pay a fee when you buy them, which is good if you don't want to pay money upfront. But if you plan to keep your money in the fund for a medium time, like 3 to 7 years, B shares could be better. They also don't charge a fee when you buy them, and the fee for selling goes down the longer you keep your money in the fund. For long-term goals, where you plan to keep your money in the fund for more than 7 years, A shares might be the best. They have the lowest yearly fees, which can save you money over time, even though you pay a big fee when you buy them.

Also, consider how much money you want to invest and how often you might need to take money out of the fund. If you have a lot of money to invest at once, A shares might be good because you can get a discount on the fee you pay when you buy them. This makes A shares more affordable for big investments. If you think you might need to take money out of the fund soon after investing, B or C shares might be better because you don't pay a fee when you buy them. But remember, B and C shares have higher yearly fees, so if you keep your money in the fund for a long time, those fees can add up and make them more expensive than A shares.

## How do financial advisors typically recommend A, B, and C shares to different types of investors?

Financial advisors often suggest A shares to people who are planning to keep their money in the fund for a long time, like more than 7 years. A shares have a big fee when you buy them, but they have the lowest yearly fees. So, if you're investing a lot of money at once, A shares can be good because you might get a discount on that big fee. Advisors usually recommend A shares to people who don't need to take money out of the fund soon and want to save money on yearly fees over time.

For people who might need to take money out of the fund sooner, like within a few years, advisors might suggest B shares. B shares don't have a fee when you buy them, which is good if you don't want to pay money upfront. But they do have a fee if you sell them within a few years, and that fee goes down the longer you keep your money in the fund. Advisors might recommend B shares to people who want to invest for a medium amount of time and don't want to pay a big fee when they buy the shares.

If you're only planning to keep your money in the fund for a short time, like less than a year, advisors might recommend C shares. C shares also don't have a fee when you buy them, which is good if you don't want to pay money upfront. But they have the highest yearly fees of the three share classes. So, advisors might suggest C shares to people who want to invest a smaller amount of money and don't plan to keep it in the fund for a long time.

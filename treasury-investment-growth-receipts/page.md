## What are Treasury Investment Growth Receipts (TIGRs)?

Treasury Investment Growth Receipts, or TIGRs, are a type of zero-coupon bond that was introduced in the 1980s. They were created by Merrill Lynch and are based on U.S. Treasury bonds. Zero-coupon means that TIGRs do not pay interest periodically like regular bonds. Instead, they are sold at a discount and mature at their full face value. This means if you buy a TIGR for less than its face value, you will get the full face value when it matures, and the difference is your earnings.

TIGRs were popular because they allowed investors to buy into U.S. Treasury securities without having to worry about reinvesting interest payments. They were especially useful for people saving for a specific future goal, like college tuition or retirement, because you know exactly how much money you will have at a certain date. However, TIGRs are no longer issued today, but similar zero-coupon Treasury securities, like STRIPS, are still available for investors.

## How do TIGRs differ from traditional Treasury securities?

TIGRs are different from traditional Treasury securities mainly because they are zero-coupon bonds. This means they don't pay interest every year like regular Treasury bonds do. Instead, you buy a TIGR for less than what it's worth and wait until it matures. When it matures, you get the full amount. So, if you bought a TIGR for $800 that has a face value of $1000, you would get $1000 when it matures. The difference, $200, is your earnings.

Another difference is that TIGRs were created by a private company, Merrill Lynch, not directly by the U.S. government like traditional Treasury securities. This made them a bit different because they were based on U.S. Treasury bonds but repackaged. TIGRs were useful for people saving for something in the future because they knew exactly how much money they would have at a certain time. However, TIGRs aren't issued anymore, but you can still find similar products like STRIPS.

## What is the history and origin of TIGRs?

Treasury Investment Growth Receipts, or TIGRs, started in the 1980s. They were made by a big company called Merrill Lynch. TIGRs were a new way for people to invest in U.S. Treasury bonds. They were special because they were zero-coupon bonds. This means they did not pay interest every year like normal bonds do. Instead, you bought them for less than their full value and waited until they matured. When they matured, you got the full amount, and the difference was your profit.

TIGRs became popular because they helped people save for things like college or retirement. They knew exactly how much money they would have at a certain time in the future. However, TIGRs stopped being made after a while. But the idea of zero-coupon Treasury securities did not go away. Now, people can buy similar products called STRIPS, which are also based on U.S. Treasury securities and work in a similar way.

## How are TIGRs structured and what are their key features?

TIGRs are a kind of bond that was made in the 1980s. They are special because they are zero-coupon bonds. This means they don't give you money every year like other bonds do. Instead, you buy them for less than what they're worth. For example, you might buy a TIGR for $800 that is worth $1000. You wait until it matures, and then you get the full $1000. The difference, which is $200 in this case, is your profit.

The way TIGRs work is simple. They are based on U.S. Treasury bonds but were made by a company called Merrill Lynch. This made them different because they were not issued directly by the government. TIGRs were great for people saving for something in the future because they knew exactly how much money they would get at a certain time. But, TIGRs are not made anymore. Instead, you can find similar things called STRIPS, which work in a similar way.

## Who can invest in TIGRs and what are the eligibility criteria?

Anyone can invest in TIGRs if they were available. They were made for people who wanted to save money for something in the future, like college or retirement. You didn't need to be rich or have a special job to buy them. All you needed was the money to buy the TIGR at the discounted price.

Since TIGRs are not issued anymore, you can't buy them now. But if they were still around, you would just need to find a place that sold them, like a bank or a broker. They were easy to buy and didn't have any special rules or requirements other than having the money to buy them.

## What are the potential benefits of investing in TIGRs?

Investing in TIGRs had several benefits. One big benefit was that they were zero-coupon bonds. This means you didn't get interest payments every year. Instead, you bought them for less than they were worth and got the full amount when they matured. This was good for people saving for something specific in the future, like college or retirement, because they knew exactly how much money they would have at a certain time.

Another benefit was that TIGRs were based on U.S. Treasury bonds, which are very safe. This made TIGRs a safe way to invest your money. They were also easy to buy and didn't need special qualifications, so anyone with the money could invest in them. Even though TIGRs are not issued anymore, similar products like STRIPS offer similar benefits today.

## What are the risks associated with TIGRs?

One risk of investing in TIGRs is that they are zero-coupon bonds. This means you don't get any money until they mature. If you need money before they mature, you might have to sell them before they reach their full value. This could mean you lose money or don't make as much as you hoped.

Another risk is that the value of TIGRs can go up and down while you're waiting for them to mature. If interest rates go up, the value of your TIGR might go down. This is because new bonds would be issued with higher interest rates, making your TIGR less attractive to other investors. If you need to sell your TIGR before it matures, you might get less money than you paid for it.

## How do TIGRs fit into a diversified investment portfolio?

TIGRs can be a good part of a diversified investment portfolio because they offer a safe and predictable way to save for the future. Since they are based on U.S. Treasury bonds, they are very secure. This means they can balance out riskier investments like stocks. If you have TIGRs in your portfolio, you know exactly how much money you will get when they mature. This can help you plan for things like college tuition or retirement.

However, TIGRs are not issued anymore, so you can't buy them now. But similar products like STRIPS work the same way and can be used instead. Adding these zero-coupon bonds to your portfolio can help spread out your investments. This means if one part of your investments goes down, the TIGRs or STRIPS can help keep your overall portfolio stable. They are especially useful if you want to make sure you have a certain amount of money at a specific time in the future.

## What are the tax implications of investing in TIGRs?

When you invest in TIGRs, you need to think about taxes. Even though TIGRs don't pay interest every year, the IRS says you have to pay taxes on the interest they earn each year. This is called imputed interest. So, even though you don't get the money until the TIGR matures, you still have to pay taxes on the interest it's [earning](/wiki/earning-announcement) every year.

This can be tricky because you have to pay taxes on money you haven't actually received yet. You might need to use other money to pay these taxes. But when the TIGR matures and you get the full amount, you won't have to pay taxes on it again because you've already paid taxes on the interest over the years.

## How can one purchase TIGRs and what are the transaction processes?

TIGRs are no longer available for purchase because they stopped being issued a long time ago. But if they were still around, you could buy them from a bank or a broker. You would need to find a place that sold them and then decide how much you wanted to invest. You would give them the money, and they would give you the TIGR, which is like a promise that you'll get a certain amount of money when it matures.

The process of buying TIGRs would be pretty simple. You would tell the bank or broker how much you wanted to invest and they would find a TIGR that matched what you wanted. They would sell it to you for less than its full value, and you would keep it until it matured. When it matured, you would get the full amount of money. But since TIGRs aren't available anymore, you can look into similar products like STRIPS if you're interested in zero-coupon bonds.

## What are the current market trends and future outlook for TIGRs?

TIGRs are no longer available in the market because they stopped being issued a long time ago. They were popular in the 1980s but have been replaced by similar products like STRIPS. Since TIGRs are not being issued anymore, there are no current market trends specifically for them. Instead, people look at trends for zero-coupon bonds and U.S. Treasury securities in general. These trends can show how people are investing in safe, predictable ways to save for the future.

The future outlook for TIGRs is not relevant since they are no longer available. However, the future of zero-coupon bonds like STRIPS looks stable. People still like these kinds of investments because they are safe and you know exactly how much money you will get at a certain time. As long as the U.S. government keeps issuing Treasury securities, there will be opportunities for people to invest in similar products. This means that while TIGRs are a thing of the past, the idea behind them continues to be important for investors looking for safe and predictable investments.

## How do TIGRs compare to other zero-coupon securities in terms of performance and yield?

TIGRs were a type of zero-coupon bond that was popular in the 1980s. They were based on U.S. Treasury bonds and were sold at a discount, meaning you could buy them for less than their face value. When they matured, you got the full face value, and the difference was your profit. TIGRs had a similar performance and yield to other zero-coupon securities like STRIPS because they were both backed by U.S. Treasury securities. This meant they were very safe investments, but the yield depended on the interest rates at the time you bought them. If interest rates went up after you bought a TIGR, its value might go down, but you would still get the full face value at maturity.

Even though TIGRs are no longer issued, comparing them to other zero-coupon securities like STRIPS can help understand their performance. Both TIGRs and STRIPS are zero-coupon, so you don't get interest payments along the way. Instead, you wait until they mature to get your money. The yield on both depends on how much of a discount you buy them at and how long you have to wait until they mature. For example, if you buy a TIGR or a STRIP for $800 that will be worth $1000 when it matures, your yield is based on that $200 difference over the time you hold it. The main difference is that TIGRs were created by Merrill Lynch, while STRIPS are directly issued by the U.S. Treasury.

## What are the mechanics of TIGRs?

Treasury Investment Growth Receipts (TIGRs) were engineered through a financial mechanism termed as stripping. In this process, the interest coupons from U.S. Treasury bonds were separated from the principal, resulting in distinct zero-coupon securities. The core of the strategy rested on offering these stripped instruments to investors at a discount from their face value. Upon reaching maturity, investors would reclaim the full face value, thereby achieving a profit derived from the natural appreciation over time.

The mechanics can be expressed in simplified formulaic terms for clarity. Given the face value $F$ and the purchased price $P$ of a TIGR, the accrued profit at maturity $M$ can be represented as:

$$

M = F - P 
$$

Moreover, due to the intrinsic nature of zero-coupon bonds like TIGRs, periodic interest payments are absent. Instead, the profit is encapsulated within the difference between the discounted purchase price and the face value at maturity. This financial structure lends the advantage of predictable returns devoid of periodic [interest rate](/wiki/interest-rate-trading-strategies) fluctuations, a feature particularly attractive during times of interest rate [volatility](/wiki/volatility-trading-strategies).

Even though TIGRs ceased issuance in 1986, their continued activity in secondary markets underscores their perceived safety and steady returns. Investors in these markets value TIGRs for the predictability they offer, as they are backed by the U.S. government's obligation to honor the face value at maturity. Consequently, despite their retirement as a direct financial product, TIGRs hold a niche position in portfolios aiming to balance risk with calculated returns.

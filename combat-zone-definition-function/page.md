```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data: Date and close prices
data = {'Date': ['2021-01-01', '2021-01-02', '2021-01-03', '2021-01-04'],
        'Close': [150, 152, 151, 153]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate moving averages
df['Short_MA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=2).mean()
df['Long_MA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=4).mean()

# Determine buy/sell signals
df['Signal'] = 0
df.loc[df['Short_MA'] > df['Long_MA'], 'Signal'] = 1
df.loc[df['Short_MA'] < df['Long_MA'], 'Signal'] = -1

print(df)
```

This code calculates short-term and long-term moving averages for stock prices, generating buy/sell signals based on their crossover. Such strategies emulate tactical elements found in military operations, where decisions are adjusted dynamically based on the latest data to achieve strategic objectives.

## Who was Jesse L. Livermore?

Jesse L. Livermore was a famous stock trader and speculator in the early 20th century. He was born in 1877 in Massachusetts and started trading when he was just 14 years old. Livermore became very successful and made a lot of money by trading stocks and commodities. He was known for his ability to predict market trends and make big profits from them.

However, Livermore's life was not always easy. He faced many ups and downs in his career and personal life. He made and lost several fortunes over the years. Despite his success, he struggled with depression and financial troubles. Sadly, in 1940, Livermore took his own life. His life story has been told in the book "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator," which is still popular among traders today.

## What was Jesse L. Livermore's educational background?

Jesse L. Livermore did not have a lot of formal education. He left school when he was very young, around the age of 14. Instead of staying in school, he started working at a stock brokerage firm as a chalkboard boy. His job was to write stock prices on a board for people to see. This early job gave him a chance to learn about the stock market.

Even though he didn't go to college or finish high school, Livermore was very smart about trading. He learned everything he needed to know by watching the market and talking to other traders. He taught himself how to make money by understanding how the stock market worked. His lack of formal education did not stop him from becoming one of the most successful traders of his time.

After a while, Livermore started trading on his own. He would go to a bucket shop, which was a place where people could bet on stock prices without actually buying the stocks. He used the knowledge he gained from his job to make smart bets and started making money. By the time he was 15, he had made his first big profit of $1,000, which was a lot of money back then.

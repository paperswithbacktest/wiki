It was created by Congress in 1975 and works to protect investors, state and local governments, and others who buy, sell, or work with municipal securities. These securities are bonds issued by states, cities, and other public entities to raise money for public projects like schools, roads, and hospitals.

The MSRB does not directly enforce rules but creates them and works with other organizations like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to make sure they are followed. It focuses on making rules about how dealers and others in the market should behave to keep things honest and transparent. The MSRB also provides important information and tools to help people understand the municipal securities market better.

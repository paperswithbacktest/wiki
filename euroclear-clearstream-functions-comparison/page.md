In terms of code, Euroclear might utilize sophisticated algorithms to ensure these processes are completed accurately. A simplistic example in Python could be:

```python
def settle_trade(trade, ledger):
    # Simulate verification of trade
    if verify_trade(trade):
        # Record in a distributed ledger
        ledger.append(trade)
        return "Settlement successful"
    else:
        return "Settlement failed"

def verify_trade(trade):
    # Placeholder for verification logic
    return True

# Sample ledger and trade
ledger = []
trade = {"id": 101, "amount": 10000, "currency": "EUR"}

status = settle_trade(trade, ledger)
print(status)
```

This code snippet represents a highly simplified model simulating trade settlement incorporating verification and ledger logging. In practice, Euroclear would deploy far more complex and secure systems.

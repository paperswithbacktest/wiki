## What is the expected impact of Kamala Harris's economic plan on the national debt?

Kamala Harris's economic plan might increase the national debt because it involves spending more money on things like raising the minimum wage, investing in infrastructure, and funding programs for affordable healthcare and education.

On the other hand, if Harris's plan helps the economy grow by creating jobs and helping small businesses, it could lead to more people paying taxes. When more people work and earn money, they pay more in taxes, which can help reduce the national debt over time.

## What are the criticisms and challenges of implementing Kamala Harris's economic plan?

Some people think Kamala Harris's economic plan might be hard to put into action. They worry that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour could make it tough for small businesses. These businesses might not have enough money to pay their workers more, which could lead to them closing down or letting people go. Another challenge is the cost of the plan. Harris wants to spend a lot of money on things like infrastructure and clean energy. If the government doesn't get enough money from taxes, it might have to borrow more, which could increase the national debt.

Critics also say that making big corporations and rich people pay more taxes might not bring in as much money as Harris hopes. Some big companies might find ways to pay less in taxes, or they might move their businesses to other countries. This could mean the government doesn't get the money it needs to pay for all the new programs. Also, some people worry that focusing so much on clean energy might hurt other parts of the economy, like the oil and coal industries. These industries employ a lot of people, and if they struggle, it could lead to job losses.

She also wants to invest in clean energy, which can create new jobs and help the environment. By spending money on these things, Harris believes the economy will get stronger and more people will have jobs. This can help everyone have a better life and make the economy grow over time.

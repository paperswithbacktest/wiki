## What is Wealthsimple and what services do they offer?

Wealthsimple is a Canadian company that helps people invest their money easily. They started in 2014 and have become popular because they make investing simple and affordable. Wealthsimple uses technology to manage your investments for you, so you don't need to be an expert to start investing. They offer different types of accounts, like personal accounts, accounts for kids, and even accounts for businesses.

Wealthsimple offers several services to help you grow your money. One of their main services is called Wealthsimple Invest, where they automatically invest your money in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your goals and how much risk you're willing to take. They also have Wealthsimple Trade, which lets you buy and sell individual stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on your own. Another service is Wealthsimple Cash, which is a high-interest savings account that helps your money grow faster than in a regular bank account.

## How does Wealthsimple make money?

Wealthsimple makes money by charging fees for the services they offer. For their Wealthsimple Invest service, they charge a management fee, which is a small percentage of the money you have invested with them. This fee is how they pay for managing your investments and making sure your money is working hard for you. The more money you have invested, the less the percentage fee becomes, which means Wealthsimple rewards you for investing more.

For Wealthsimple Trade, they make money in a different way. They charge a small fee when you trade stocks or ETFs, but only if you use their premium service called Wealthsimple Trade Plus. If you use the regular Wealthsimple Trade service, there are no trading fees, but Wealthsimple still makes money through something called the "spread," which is the difference between the price you buy a stock at and the price someone else is willing to sell it for. This spread is very small, but it adds up when a lot of people are trading.

Wealthsimple Cash, their high-interest savings account, also helps them make money. They pay you interest on the money you keep in the account, but they invest that money in other ways to earn even more interest. The difference between what they pay you and what they earn is how they make money from this service. So, Wealthsimple uses a mix of fees and interest to keep their business running and growing.

## What are the different types of accounts available at Wealthsimple?

Wealthsimple offers different types of accounts to help people save and invest their money. They have personal accounts for adults who want to invest for their future.

TFSAs let you invest money without paying taxes on the money you earn, while RRSPs help you save for retirement with tax benefits. All these accounts are designed to make investing easy and help you reach your financial goals.

## How does Wealthsimple's investment strategy work?

Fidelity is a big company that helps people invest their money. They offer different ways to invest, like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Fidelity has been around for a long time and many people trust them because they have a lot of experience. They also have tools and advice to help you make good choices with your money.

Robinhood is a newer company that makes it easy for people to start investing. They are known for letting you buy and sell stocks without paying any fees, which is different from many other companies. Robinhood has a simple app that you can use on your phone, making it easy for beginners to get started. However, they offer fewer types of investments compared to Fidelity.

## How do the account opening processes differ between Fidelity and Robinhood?

Opening an account with Fidelity is a bit more involved than with Robinhood. When you start with Fidelity, you need to fill out a form with your personal information like your name, address, and Social Security number. They might ask you some questions about your investment goals and experience. After you submit your application, Fidelity will review it, and if everything is okay, they'll ask you to fund your account. This means you'll need to put some money into your account before you can start investing. The whole process can take a few days because of the review and funding steps.

On the other hand, opening an account with Robinhood is quick and easy. You can do it all on their app or website. You'll need to provide your personal information, like your name, address, and Social Security number, just like with Fidelity. But after you fill out the form, Robinhood usually approves your account pretty fast, sometimes in just a few minutes. Once your account is approved, you can start investing right away, even if you don't add money immediately. This makes Robinhood a good choice if you want to get started quickly.

At Fidelity, you don't have to pay any fees to trade U.S. stocks and ETFs. This means you can buy and sell these kinds of investments without spending extra money on fees. However, if you want to trade things like options or mutual funds, there might be some fees. For example, trading options at Fidelity costs $0.65 per contract. It's good to check their website for the latest information on fees because they can change.

Robinhood also lets you trade U.S. stocks and ETFs without any fees. Just like Fidelity, you can buy and sell these investments for free. Robinhood doesn't charge for options trading either, but there's a fee of $0.50 per contract.

At Fidelity, you can earn interest on the cash you keep in your account. They call it the "Fidelity Cash Management Account" and the [interest rate](/wiki/interest-rate-trading-strategies) changes depending on how much money you have.

Fidelity has a lot of advanced trading features and tools that can help you make smart choices about your investments. They have things like detailed charts and graphs that show you how your investments are doing over time. You can also set up alerts to let you know when a stock reaches a certain price.

This can be really useful if you want to be very specific about when you buy or sell. They also have tools for people who like to trade a lot, like being able to see real-time market data and even trade options with complex strategies.

This issue is compounded by a rapidly evolving job market, where the pace of technological advancement can outstrip the current workforce's skill set. Regulatory barriers further constrain mobility, such as licensing requirements or restrictions on occupational entry, which can discourage individuals from pursuing different career paths.

To quantify the impact of labor mobility on economic growth, researchers might employ models that incorporate variables representing educational attainment, skill levels, and industry growth rates. For example, a simple regression model can assess the relationship between labor mobility and economic output:

```python
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Sample data: mobility (as a percentage), GDP growth rate
mobility = np.array([10, 20, 15, 25, 18])  # % of labor force
gdp_growth = np.array([2.5, 3.6, 3.0, 4.0, 3.2])  # % GDP growth

# Adding a constant term for the intercept
X = sm.add_constant(mobility)
model = sm.OLS(gdp_growth, X).fit()

# Displaying the summary of the regression model
print(model.summary())
```

While cultivating occupational labor mobility is critical, overcoming the challenges requires concerted efforts through education, policy-making, and industry collaboration to ensure a skilled, adaptable, and resilient labor force.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Example of calculating a simple moving average with pandas
def calculate_sma(prices, window):
    return prices.rolling(window=window).mean()

# Sample data
close_prices = pd.Series([150, 155, 157, 160, 162])
sma = calculate_sma(close_prices, window=3)
print(sma)
```

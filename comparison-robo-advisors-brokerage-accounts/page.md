## What is a robo-advisor?

A robo-advisor is a type of automated financial service that uses computer algorithms to manage your investments. It's like having a personal financial advisor, but instead of a person, it's a computer program that does the work. You tell the robo-advisor about your financial goals and how much risk you're willing to take, and then it creates and manages a portfolio of investments for you.

Robo-advisors are popular because they are usually cheaper than hiring a human financial advisor. They can manage your money for a small fee, often less than 1% of your total investment. They also make investing easier because they do all the work for you, from choosing the right investments to rebalancing your portfolio when needed. This makes them a good option for people who want to invest but don't have a lot of time or knowledge about the stock market.

## What is a brokerage account?

A brokerage account is like a special kind of bank account where you can buy and sell investments like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. It's managed by a brokerage firm, which is a company that helps you make these trades. When you put money into a brokerage account, you can use it to invest in different things, hoping that they will grow in value over time.

Opening a brokerage account is pretty easy. You just need to choose a brokerage firm, fill out some forms, and maybe deposit some money to get started. Once your account is set up, you can start buying and selling investments through the firm's website or app. It's a good way to start investing if you want to grow your money over time.

## How do robo-advisors and brokerage accounts differ in terms of cost?

Robo-advisors and brokerage accounts have different costs. Robo-advisors usually charge a small fee, often less than 1% of your total investment. This fee covers the service of managing your investments automatically. For example, if you have $10,000 invested with a robo-advisor that charges 0.25%, you would pay $25 a year. This makes robo-advisors a cheaper option if you want someone to manage your investments for you.

Brokerage accounts, on the other hand, might not charge a management fee like robo-advisors do. Instead, they might charge you every time you buy or sell an investment. These charges are called trading fees or commissions. Some brokerage firms offer free trades, but others might charge a few dollars for each trade. If you trade a lot, these fees can add up, making brokerage accounts more expensive than robo-advisors for some people.

In summary, robo-advisors are usually cheaper if you want your investments managed for you, while brokerage accounts can be cheaper if you do your own investing and don't trade often. It's important to look at the fees and how often you plan to trade to decide which option is best for you.

## What level of investment control do users have with robo-advisors versus brokerage accounts?

With robo-advisors, you have less control over your investments. You tell the robo-advisor about your goals and how much risk you're okay with, and it picks and manages your investments for you. You can't choose specific stocks or make trades yourself. The robo-advisor does all that for you based on what you told it. This can be good if you don't want to spend time [picking](/wiki/asset-class-picking) investments, but it means you have to trust the robo-advisor to make the right choices for you.

With a brokerage account, you have a lot more control. You can pick exactly which stocks, bonds, or other investments you want to buy or sell. You can make trades whenever you want, and you're in charge of managing your portfolio. This gives you the freedom to follow your own investment strategy, but it also means you need to know what you're doing and be willing to spend time on it. If you like being in control and making your own decisions, a brokerage account might be a better fit for you.

## How do the investment options available in robo-advisors compare to those in brokerage accounts?

Robo-advisors usually offer a limited set of investment options compared to brokerage accounts. They often stick to things like ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and index funds. These are broad, diversified investments that spread your money across lots of different stocks or bonds. Robo-advisors choose these investments based on your goals and how much risk you're okay with. So, you won't be able to pick specific stocks or other niche investments with a robo-advisor.

Brokerage accounts give you a lot more choices. You can buy and sell individual stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, options, and sometimes even more exotic things like cryptocurrencies or commodities. This means you can tailor your investments to exactly what you want, whether it's a single company's stock or a mix of different types of investments. With a brokerage account, you have the freedom to build your portfolio the way you think is best, but you also need to do more research and make your own decisions.

## What are the typical minimum investment requirements for robo-advisors and brokerage accounts?

Robo-advisors often have minimum investment requirements that can range from $0 to several thousand dollars. Some popular robo-advisors might ask for as little as $500 to start, while others might need $5,000 or more. This minimum is there to make sure the robo-advisor can manage your money effectively. If you don't have enough money to meet the minimum, you might not be able to use that robo-advisor.

Brokerage accounts usually have lower or no minimum investment requirements. Many brokerage firms let you open an account with no money at all, and you can start investing with whatever amount you can afford. This makes brokerage accounts more accessible if you're just starting out or don't have a lot of money to invest right away. But remember, even if you can start with a small amount, you'll need more money to buy some investments, like stocks, which can have their own minimum purchase requirements.

## How do robo-advisors and brokerage accounts handle tax strategies?

Robo-advisors often have some built-in tax strategies to help you save money on taxes. One common strategy they use is called tax-loss harvesting. This means they sell investments that have lost value to offset the taxes you owe on your gains. Robo-advisors do this automatically, so you don't have to think about it. However, the tax strategies of robo-advisors are usually pretty simple and might not be as personalized as what you could get from a human advisor.

Brokerage accounts give you more control over your tax strategies, but you have to do the work yourself. You can choose when to buy and sell investments to manage your taxes better. For example, you can decide to sell investments that have lost value to use tax-loss harvesting, or you can hold onto investments for over a year to get a lower tax rate on your gains. If you know a lot about taxes and want to tailor your strategy, a brokerage account lets you do that. But if you're not sure what to do, you might need to talk to a tax professional to make the best choices.

## What kind of customer support can users expect from robo-advisors versus brokerage accounts?

With robo-advisors, customer support is usually available through email, phone, or chat, but it might not be as personal as with a human advisor. Since robo-advisors are automated, you'll often find help through FAQs and online resources rather than talking to someone directly. If you do get to talk to a person, it might be someone from a call center who can help with basic questions but might not give detailed financial advice.

Brokerage accounts usually offer more direct customer support. You can call, email, or chat with someone, and often you'll get to talk to a real person who can help you with your account or investments. Some brokerage firms even have local branches where you can go in person to get help. This can be really useful if you have complicated questions or need personalized advice about your investments.

## How do the performance histories of robo-advisors compare to those of brokerage accounts?

Comparing the performance histories of robo-advisors and brokerage accounts is tricky because they work differently. Robo-advisors use algorithms to pick a mix of investments like ETFs and index funds. They aim to give you steady growth over time. How well they do depends on how the market does and how they balance your investments. You can look at past data to see how different robo-advisors have done, but remember, past results don't guarantee future success.

Brokerage accounts let you pick your own investments, so their performance depends a lot on your choices. If you pick stocks or funds that do well, your account can grow a lot. But if your picks don't do well, you might lose money. Because everyone's choices are different, it's hard to say how brokerage accounts perform in general. You need to look at your own investments and see how they've done over time.

## What are the security and insurance features of robo-advisors and brokerage accounts?

Robo-advisors and brokerage accounts both have security measures to keep your money safe. They use things like encryption to protect your information when you're online. Both types of accounts also have two-[factor](/wiki/factor-investing) authentication, which means you need to enter a code sent to your phone or email to log in. This makes it harder for someone else to get into your account. Robo-advisors and brokerage accounts also watch for strange activity, like if someone tries to log in from a new place or make big changes to your account. If they see something odd, they might freeze your account or ask you to confirm it's really you.

Both robo-advisors and brokerage accounts are covered by something called SIPC insurance. This stands for Securities Investor Protection Corporation. SIPC insurance protects your money if the company you're using goes bankrupt. It can cover up to $500,000, including a $250,000 limit for cash. This insurance is there to make sure you get your investments back if the firm fails, but it doesn't protect you from losing money if your investments go down in value. So, while both robo-advisors and brokerage accounts have strong security and insurance, it's important to know what they cover and what they don't.

## How do robo-advisors and brokerage accounts integrate with other financial planning tools?

Robo-advisors often connect with other financial planning tools to help you manage your money better. They might link with budgeting apps like Mint or YNAB, so you can see all your money in one place. Some robo-advisors also work with tax software, like TurboTax, to make tax time easier. They can even connect with your bank accounts to automatically add money to your investments. This makes it easier to keep track of everything and plan for your financial goals.

Brokerage accounts also integrate with other financial tools, but you might need to do a bit more work to set it up. You can link your brokerage account to budgeting apps to see your investments alongside your other money. Some brokerage firms have their own tools for planning and tracking your finances, like retirement calculators or investment analysis tools. You can also use third-party apps to analyze your investments and see how they're doing. This gives you more control over how you use different tools to plan your finances.

## What advanced features do robo-advisors offer that might not be available in traditional brokerage accounts?

Robo-advisors offer some cool features that you might not find in traditional brokerage accounts. One big one is automatic rebalancing. This means the robo-advisor keeps your investments in the right mix without you having to do anything. If one part of your portfolio grows faster than the others, the robo-advisor will sell some of it and buy more of the slower-growing parts to keep things balanced. This helps keep your investments in line with your goals and risk level. Another neat feature is tax-loss harvesting, which we talked about before. Robo-advisors can do this automatically to help you save on taxes without you having to think about it.

Some robo-advisors also let you add special goals to your account, like saving for a house or a vacation. They'll set up a separate part of your portfolio just for that goal and manage it to help you reach it. This makes it easier to keep track of different savings goals without mixing them up. Plus, many robo-advisors have tools to help you plan for retirement, like showing you how much you might need and suggesting ways to get there. These features can make managing your money a lot simpler and more focused on your personal goals.

import pandas as pd

# Sample data loading
esg_data = pd.read_csv('esg_data.csv')

# Simple function to calculate ESG score impact on return
def calculate_impact(esg_score, financials):
    return financials['return'] * esg_score

# Run calculation
esg_data['impact_score'] = esg_data.apply(lambda x: calculate_impact(x['esg_score'], x), axis=1)

# Analyze high impact investments
high_impact_investments = esg_data[esg_data['impact_score'] > threshold]
```

This code snippet demonstrates leveraging ESG scores to anticipate the financial impact, aiding in identifying high-impact investments. By integrating such analytical techniques, asset managers can enhance their capacity to meet net-zero targets while maximizing financial performance.

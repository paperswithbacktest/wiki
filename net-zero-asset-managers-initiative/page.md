## What is the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative?

The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative is a group of big investment companies that want to help fight climate change. They promise to make sure the companies they invest in will have net zero carbon emissions by the year 2050. This means these companies will not add any extra carbon dioxide to the air, or they will take away as much as they add.

These investment companies also set short-term goals to lower emissions every few years. They work together and share ideas on how to reach these goals. By doing this, they hope to help the whole world move towards a future without adding to climate change.

## Who can join the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative?

Any asset manager can join the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative if they want to help fight climate change. They need to agree to make sure the companies they invest in will have net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This means these companies will not add any extra carbon dioxide to the air, or they will take away as much as they add.

Joining the initiative means asset managers must also set short-term goals to lower emissions every few years. They have to report how they are doing and share ideas with other members. This helps everyone work together to reach the big goal of a world without adding to climate change.

## What are the main goals of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative?

The main goal of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative is to help fight climate change by making sure the companies they invest in reach net zero carbon emissions by the year 2050. This means these companies will not add any extra carbon dioxide to the air, or they will take away as much as they add. By doing this, the initiative wants to help the whole world move towards a future without adding to climate change.

Another important goal is for the asset managers to set short-term targets to lower emissions every few years. This helps them keep track of their progress and make sure they are on the right path to reach the big goal by 2050. By working together and sharing ideas, the members of the initiative can learn from each other and find the best ways to reduce emissions.

## How does the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative contribute to global climate goals?

The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative helps with global climate goals by getting big investment companies to work together. They promise to make sure the companies they invest in will not add any extra carbon dioxide to the air by the year 2050. This is called reaching net zero carbon emissions. By doing this, they help the whole world move towards a future without adding to climate change.

These investment companies also set short-term goals to lower emissions every few years. This helps them keep track of their progress and make sure they are on the right path. By sharing ideas and working together, the members of the initiative can learn from each other and find the best ways to reduce emissions. This teamwork is important for reaching the big goal of a world without adding to climate change.

## What commitments do members of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative make?

Members of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative promise to make sure the companies they invest in will reach net zero carbon emissions by the year 2050. This means these companies will not add any extra carbon dioxide to the air, or they will take away as much as they add. By doing this, they help the whole world move towards a future without adding to climate change.

They also commit to setting short-term goals to lower emissions every few years. This helps them keep track of their progress and make sure they are on the right path to reach the big goal by 2050. By working together and sharing ideas, the members can learn from each other and find the best ways to reduce emissions.

## How is progress towards net zero measured and reported by members?

Members of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative measure their progress towards net zero by setting short-term goals to lower emissions every few years. They look at how much carbon dioxide the companies they invest in are putting into the air and compare it to their targets. This helps them see if they are on track to reach net zero by 2050. They use tools and methods to keep track of these numbers and make sure they are accurate.

Members report their progress regularly to show how they are doing. They share this information with other members of the initiative and sometimes with the public. This helps everyone see what is working and what needs to be improved. By being open about their progress, members can learn from each other and work together to reach the big goal of a world without adding to climate change.

## What role do asset managers play in achieving net zero emissions?

Asset managers help a lot in getting to net zero emissions. They do this by making sure the companies they invest in do not add extra carbon dioxide to the air by the year 2050. This is a big goal, and asset managers can help because they have a lot of power over the companies they invest in. By choosing to invest in companies that work towards net zero, asset managers push these companies to change how they do things to be better for the planet.

Asset managers also set short-term goals to lower emissions every few years. This helps them check if they are moving in the right direction. They share what they learn with other asset managers, so everyone can do better. By working together and being open about their progress, asset managers can make a big difference in fighting climate change and helping the world reach net zero emissions.

## Can you explain the difference between net zero and carbon neutral in the context of this initiative?

In simple terms, net zero and carbon neutral are very similar, but there's a small difference. Net zero means that a company or a group of companies does not add any extra carbon dioxide to the air, or they take away as much as they add. This is what the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative is all about. They want the companies they invest in to reach this point by 2050. To do this, these companies might use less energy, switch to clean energy, or find ways to take carbon out of the air.

Carbon neutral is a bit different. It means a company balances out the carbon dioxide it puts into the air by doing things like planting trees or buying credits that help reduce carbon somewhere else. So, while net zero focuses on not adding extra carbon or removing it, carbon neutral focuses on balancing what's added with what's taken away. Both ideas help fight climate change, but they do it in slightly different ways.

## How does the initiative align with international climate agreements like the Paris Agreement?

The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative aligns well with the Paris Agreement, which is a big international plan to fight climate change. The Paris Agreement wants countries to work together to keep the world from getting too hot. It sets a goal for the world to reach net zero carbon emissions by the middle of this century. The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative helps with this goal because it gets big investment companies to make sure the companies they invest in will not add any extra carbon dioxide to the air by 2050.

By setting short-term goals to lower emissions every few years, the members of the initiative are doing what the Paris Agreement asks countries to do. They are working together and sharing ideas to find the best ways to reduce emissions. This teamwork is important because it helps everyone move towards a future without adding to climate change, just like the Paris Agreement wants.

## What challenges do asset managers face in implementing net zero strategies?

Asset managers face several challenges when trying to put net zero strategies into action. One big challenge is getting the companies they invest in to change how they do things. These companies might need to use less energy, switch to clean energy, or find ways to take carbon out of the air. This can be hard and expensive for the companies, and they might not want to do it. Asset managers have to use their power to push these companies to make these changes, but it's not always easy.

Another challenge is figuring out the right way to measure and report progress. Asset managers need to keep track of how much carbon dioxide the companies they invest in are putting into the air. They also need to make sure these numbers are correct and share them with others. This can be tricky because different companies might use different ways to measure their emissions. Plus, asset managers have to set short-term goals and make sure they are on track to reach net zero by 2050, which adds more work and pressure.

## How does the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative collaborate with other sustainability initiatives?

The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative works with other groups that also want to help the planet. They share ideas and learn from each other to find the best ways to lower emissions. For example, they might work with the Science Based Targets initiative, which helps companies set goals to fight climate change based on science. By working together, they can make sure their plans fit well with each other and help more companies reach net zero.

They also join forces with big climate action plans like the Paris Agreement. This agreement wants countries to work together to stop the world from getting too hot. The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative helps by making sure the companies they invest in do their part to reach net zero by 2050. By being part of these bigger plans, they can help make a bigger difference in fighting climate change.

## What are some case studies or examples of successful implementation of net zero strategies by members of the initiative?

One good example of a successful net zero strategy is what the asset manager Schroders did. They worked with a company called Drax Group, which makes energy from biomass. Schroders helped Drax set a goal to be net zero by 2030, which is even earlier than the 2050 goal of the initiative. Drax started using more sustainable ways to make energy and found ways to take carbon out of the air. This showed that with the right help and goals, companies can move quickly towards net zero.

Another example is how Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) worked with a big company called Unilever. LGIM helped Unilever set clear short-term goals to lower emissions. Unilever started using less energy in their factories and switched to using more clean energy. They also made sure their products were more eco-friendly. By working together, LGIM and Unilever showed that setting clear goals and working hard can help a company make big steps towards net zero.

These examples show that when asset managers like Schroders and LGIM work closely with companies, they can help them reach net zero faster. They do this by setting clear goals, finding the best ways to lower emissions, and keeping track of progress. This teamwork is key to making sure the world can fight climate change and reach net zero by 2050.

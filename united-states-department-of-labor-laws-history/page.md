## When was the United States Department of Labor established?

The United States Department of Labor was established on March 4, 1913. Before that, there was a different department called the Department of Commerce and Labor. In 1913, President William Howard Taft signed a law to split this department into two. This created the Department of Labor as a separate entity.

The new Department of Labor focused on helping workers and their families. It aimed to improve working conditions, wages, and job opportunities. Over the years, the department has grown and now includes many programs and agencies that support workers across the country.

## What are some key laws administered by the Department of Labor?

The Department of Labor helps make sure workers are treated fairly by enforcing several important laws. One key law is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This law sets rules about the minimum wage, overtime pay, and how young people can work. It helps make sure workers get paid enough and are not overworked. Another important law is the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). This law makes sure workplaces are safe and healthy. It sets rules to protect workers from getting hurt or sick on the job.

This law lets workers take time off to care for a new baby, a sick family member, or their own health without losing their job. It helps balance work and family life. Additionally, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is another key law. It protects workers' retirement and health plans. It makes sure that the money workers put into these plans is safe and used correctly.

These laws are important because they help protect workers' rights and well-being. The Department of Labor works hard to make sure these laws are followed so that all workers can have fair and safe jobs.

## How does the Department of Labor enforce labor laws?

The Department of Labor enforces labor laws by checking if businesses are following the rules. They do this by doing inspections and investigations. If someone thinks their employer is not following the law, they can file a complaint with the Department of Labor. The department will then look into the complaint to see if it is true. They might visit the workplace to talk to workers and check records. If they find that a business is breaking the law, they can make the business fix the problem and pay any money they owe to workers.

The Department of Labor also educates businesses and workers about the laws. They give out information and hold training sessions to help people understand what the laws say. This helps prevent problems before they start. If a business does not follow the law even after being told to fix things, the Department of Labor can take them to court. They can ask a judge to make the business follow the law and pay fines. This way, the Department of Labor makes sure that workers are treated fairly and workplaces are safe.

## What is the Fair Labor Standards Act and its impact?

The Fair Labor Standards Act, or FLSA, is a very important law in the United States. It was passed in 1938 to help protect workers. The FLSA sets rules about the minimum wage, which is the lowest amount of money a worker can be paid. It also says that if workers work more than 40 hours in a week, they should get extra pay, called overtime pay. Another part of the FLSA is about child labor. It limits how many hours young people can work and what kinds of jobs they can do, to keep them safe.

The impact of the FLSA has been big. It has helped millions of workers by making sure they get paid fairly. Before the FLSA, many workers were paid very little and worked long hours. The law changed that by setting a minimum wage and overtime rules. This helped workers earn enough to live on and have more time for family and rest. The child labor rules also made workplaces safer for young people. Overall, the FLSA has made a big difference in improving the lives of workers across the country.

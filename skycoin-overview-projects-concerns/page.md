## What is Skycoin and what is its primary purpose?

Skycoin is a type of cryptocurrency that was created to make the internet faster and more private. It was started in 2013 by a group of people who wanted to build a new kind of internet. They called this new internet the "Skywire" network. Skycoin is the money used within this network to pay for services and to reward people who help run the network.

The main purpose of Skycoin is to support the Skywire network, which is designed to be a better version of the internet. It aims to solve problems like slow internet speeds and lack of privacy. With Skycoin, users can pay for faster internet connections and keep their online activities private. The Skywire network is run by people all over the world who share their internet connection, and they get paid in Skycoin for doing this. This way, the network can grow and improve without being controlled by big companies.

## Who founded Skycoin and when was it launched?

Skycoin was founded by a person named Synth. Synth is a computer programmer who wanted to make the internet better. He started working on Skycoin in 2013. He wanted to create a new kind of internet that would be faster and more private.

Skycoin was officially launched in 2017. This is when people could start using it and trading it. The launch of Skycoin was an important step in building the Skywire network, which is the new internet that Synth and his team were working on.

## How does Skycoin's consensus mechanism work?

Skycoin uses a special way to make sure everyone agrees on what's happening on its network. It's called Obelisk, which is different from the usual ways like Bitcoin's mining. In Obelisk, there's no need for mining, which means computers don't have to solve hard math problems to add new transactions to the network. Instead, Skycoin uses a group of trusted people called "subscribers" who help keep the network running smoothly. These subscribers are chosen based on how much Skycoin they have and how much they help the network.

When someone wants to add a new set of transactions to the Skycoin network, the subscribers vote on it. If most of the subscribers agree, the new set of transactions gets added to the network. This way, the network stays safe and everyone can trust that the transactions are correct. It's like a group of friends deciding on what to do, where everyone's voice matters, but they need to agree to move forward.

## What is the Skywire project and how does it relate to Skycoin?

The Skywire project is a plan to build a new kind of internet that is faster and more private. It's like a big network where people from all over the world share their internet connection to help others get online. Instead of big companies controlling the internet, regular people can help run it and get paid for their help. This new internet is called the Skywire network, and it's meant to make the internet better for everyone.

Skycoin is the money used in the Skywire network. When people help run the network by sharing their internet, they get paid in Skycoin. This helps the network grow because more people want to join in and help. Skycoin makes it easy for people to pay for faster internet and keep their online activities private. So, Skycoin and Skywire work together to make the internet a better place.

## What are the key features of the Skycoin ecosystem?

The Skycoin ecosystem has several important features that make it unique. One key feature is the Skywire network, which is a new kind of internet that aims to be faster and more private. People can share their internet connection to help others get online, and they get paid in Skycoin for doing this. This makes the internet more open and less controlled by big companies. Another important feature is the Obelisk consensus mechanism, which is different from other cryptocurrencies. Instead of mining, a group of trusted people called subscribers vote on new transactions. This makes the network safe and fair without using a lot of energy.

Another feature of the Skycoin ecosystem is the use of Skycoin as its currency. Skycoin is used to pay for services on the Skywire network and to reward people who help run it. This helps the network grow and stay strong. Skycoin also has a wallet called the Skycoin Wallet, which makes it easy for people to store, send, and receive Skycoin. This wallet is simple to use and helps people manage their money on the Skywire network. Together, these features make the Skycoin ecosystem a special place where people can enjoy a better internet.

## How does Skycoin address privacy and security concerns?

Skycoin takes privacy and security very seriously. It uses the Skywire network to make the internet more private. When you use Skywire, your internet connection goes through many different people's computers instead of just one big company. This makes it hard for anyone to spy on what you're doing online. Also, Skycoin uses something called end-to-end encryption, which means your messages and data are locked up tight and only the person you're talking to can see them. This keeps your information safe from hackers and other bad guys.

Another way Skycoin keeps things secure is with its Obelisk consensus mechanism. Instead of mining like other cryptocurrencies, Skycoin uses a group of trusted people called subscribers to vote on new transactions. This makes the network safe because it's hard for anyone to cheat or mess things up. Plus, Skycoin doesn't need a lot of energy to run, which makes it more secure and better for the environment. By using these methods, Skycoin helps make sure your online activities stay private and your money stays safe.

## What is the total supply of Skycoin and how is it distributed?

The total supply of Skycoin is 100 million coins. This means that there will never be more than 100 million Skycoins in the world. This is different from some other cryptocurrencies that can keep making new coins over time. Skycoin's fixed supply helps keep its value stable because people know exactly how many coins there are.

Skycoin's distribution started with an initial distribution of coins to early supporters and the development team. Over time, more coins have been given out to people who help run the Skywire network by sharing their internet connection. This way, people who help make the network better get rewarded with Skycoin. The rest of the coins are used for things like funding new projects and keeping the ecosystem growing.

## How can someone acquire Skycoin and what are the common use cases?

Someone can acquire Skycoin in a few different ways. One way is to buy it from a [cryptocurrency](/wiki/cryptocurrency) exchange that supports Skycoin. You can use other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum to trade for Skycoin on these exchanges. Another way to get Skycoin is by helping to run the Skywire network. If you share your internet connection to help others get online, you can earn Skycoin as a reward. This is a good way to get Skycoin if you want to support the network and get paid for it.

Skycoin has several common use cases within its ecosystem. One main use is to pay for services on the Skywire network. If you want faster and more private internet, you can use Skycoin to pay for it. Another use is to reward people who help run the Skywire network. By sharing their internet, they get paid in Skycoin, which encourages more people to join and help the network grow. Skycoin can also be used for trading and investing, just like other cryptocurrencies, where people buy and sell it hoping its value will go up over time.

## What are some of the major projects or partnerships associated with Skycoin?

Skycoin has worked on several big projects to make the internet better. One of the main projects is the Skywire network, which is a new kind of internet that is faster and more private. People from all over the world can help run this network by sharing their internet connection, and they get paid in Skycoin for doing this. Another project is the development of the Skycoin Wallet, which is a simple way for people to store, send, and receive Skycoin. This wallet helps make it easy for anyone to use Skycoin and be part of the Skywire network.

Skycoin has also worked with other groups to grow its ecosystem. One important partnership is with the Fiber project, which is about building a global network of high-speed internet connections. This partnership helps make the Skywire network even better by using Fiber's technology. Skycoin has also teamed up with other blockchain projects and developers to create new tools and services that work with Skycoin. These partnerships help make the Skycoin ecosystem stronger and more useful for everyone.

## What criticisms or controversies have been associated with Skycoin?

Some people have criticized Skycoin because they think it's too hard to understand. They say the way Skycoin works, with the Skywire network and the Obelisk consensus, is too complicated for regular people. They also worry that not enough people know about Skycoin, which makes it hard to use and not very popular. Some critics also think that the way Skycoin is given out to people who help run the network might not be fair. They say it might be too easy for the people who started Skycoin to control how the coins are shared.

Another controversy around Skycoin is about its founder, Synth. Some people have questioned who Synth really is and if he can be trusted. They think that because Synth is not very well-known, it's hard to trust him and the whole Skycoin project. There have also been concerns about the way Skycoin was launched. Some people think that the initial distribution of coins was not done in a way that everyone could see and agree with. These criticisms and controversies make some people hesitant to use or invest in Skycoin.

## How does Skycoin compare to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum?

Skycoin is different from Bitcoin and Ethereum in a few big ways. First, Skycoin uses a special way to keep the network safe called Obelisk, which doesn't need mining like Bitcoin does. This means Skycoin uses less energy and is better for the environment. Also, Skycoin has a fixed total supply of 100 million coins, while Bitcoin and Ethereum can keep making new coins over time. Skycoin is also the money used in the Skywire network, which is a new kind of internet that aims to be faster and more private. This is different from Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are mainly used for buying things and running smart contracts.

Another big difference is how Skycoin is given out. People can earn Skycoin by helping to run the Skywire network, which is not something you can do with Bitcoin or Ethereum. This helps the Skywire network grow because more people want to join and help. Skycoin also focuses a lot on privacy and security, using things like end-to-end encryption and a network that's hard to spy on. While Bitcoin and Ethereum also care about privacy, they don't have the same kind of network that Skycoin does. So, Skycoin is trying to do something different by making the internet better, while Bitcoin and Ethereum are more about being money and running apps.

## What are the future development plans for Skycoin and its related projects?

Skycoin has big plans for the future. One of the main goals is to keep growing the Skywire network. They want more people to join and help run the network by sharing their internet connection. This will make the internet faster and more private for everyone. They also want to make the Skycoin Wallet even better, so it's easier for people to use and manage their Skycoin. Another important plan is to work on new projects and tools that use Skycoin. This will make the whole Skycoin ecosystem more useful and interesting for people.

Another focus for Skycoin is to build more partnerships. They want to work with other groups and projects to make the Skywire network even stronger. For example, they are working with the Fiber project to build a global network of high-speed internet connections. This will help make the Skywire network better and reach more people. Skycoin also wants to keep improving the Obelisk consensus mechanism to make sure the network stays safe and fair. By doing all these things, Skycoin hopes to make the internet a better place for everyone in the future.

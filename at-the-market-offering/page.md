## What is an At-the-Market (ATM) offering?

An At-the-Market (ATM) offering is a way for companies to sell their shares directly into the public market. Instead of selling a large number of shares all at once, the company can sell shares gradually over time. They do this through a broker who sells the shares at the current market price. This method helps the company raise money without causing big changes in the stock price.

Companies often use ATM offerings when they need money for things like expanding their business or paying off debts. It's a flexible way to get funds because the company can decide when and how many shares to sell. This can be better than other methods where they have to sell a fixed number of shares at a set time. However, it's important for the company to be careful not to sell too many shares, as it could dilute the value of existing shares.

## How does an ATM offering differ from a traditional public offering?

An ATM offering is different from a traditional public offering because of how and when the shares are sold. In a traditional public offering, a company sells a fixed number of shares all at once at a set price. This means the company knows exactly how much money it will get from the offering. It's like selling a big batch of cookies at a set price. On the other hand, an ATM offering lets a company sell shares gradually over time at the current market price. It's more like selling cookies one by one throughout the day, adjusting the price based on demand.

Another difference is the impact on the stock price. A traditional public offering can cause the stock price to drop because a lot of new shares are added to the market all at once. This is similar to flooding the market with cookies, which might make each cookie less valuable. An ATM offering is usually less disruptive because the shares are sold slowly. This helps keep the stock price more stable, like selling cookies gradually so the market doesn't get overwhelmed. 

Lastly, the purpose and flexibility of the offerings differ. A traditional public offering is often used for big projects or acquisitions where a large amount of money is needed right away. It's like needing a lot of money to open a new store. An ATM offering gives a company more flexibility because it can decide when and how many shares to sell based on its current needs. This is useful for ongoing expenses or smaller projects, like buying new equipment over time.

## What are the benefits of using an ATM offering for a company?

Using an ATM offering can be really helpful for a company because it gives them a lot of flexibility. Instead of selling all their shares at once, they can sell them little by little over time. This means they can choose when to sell based on what's happening in the market and their own needs. If they need money for something small, like buying new equipment, they can sell just a few shares. If they need more money later, they can sell more shares then. This way, they don't have to worry about having too much or too little money at one time.

Another benefit is that ATM offerings can help keep the stock price stable. When a company sells a lot of shares all at once, like in a traditional public offering, it can make the stock price go down because there are suddenly a lot more shares available. But with an ATM offering, the company sells shares slowly, so it doesn't flood the market. This helps keep the price from dropping too much. It's good for the company and also for the people who already own the stock because their shares don't lose as much value.

## What types of companies typically use ATM offerings?

Companies that often use ATM offerings are usually ones that need money but want to be careful about how they get it. These are often smaller or medium-sized companies that might not have a lot of other ways to raise money. They might be in industries like biotech, where they need money to keep doing research and developing new products. Or they might be in the energy sector, where they need funds for new projects or to keep their operations going. These companies like ATM offerings because they can get money little by little, without causing big changes in their stock price.

Another type of company that uses ATM offerings is one that wants to grow or expand but needs to do it slowly. For example, a real estate company might use an ATM offering to buy new properties over time. Or a tech company might use it to fund new product development without rushing to sell a lot of shares all at once. These companies appreciate the flexibility of ATM offerings because they can decide when and how much money to raise based on their current needs and the market conditions.

## What are the potential risks or drawbacks of ATM offerings for issuers?

One potential risk of using ATM offerings is that they can dilute the value of existing shares. When a company sells more shares, it increases the total number of shares out there. This means that each share represents a smaller piece of the company, which can make the stock price go down. If the company sells too many shares over time, it might upset current shareholders who see their ownership percentage decrease. This dilution can be a big concern for investors who worry about their investment losing value.

Another drawback is that ATM offerings might not always be the best way to raise money quickly. Because the company sells shares slowly over time, it might not get the money it needs right away. If the company has urgent expenses or needs a large amount of money for a big project, an ATM offering might be too slow. Also, if the market conditions change and the stock price drops, the company might end up selling shares at a lower price than expected, which means they get less money than they planned.

## How are ATM offerings regulated?

ATM offerings are regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC makes sure that companies follow certain rules when they sell shares through an ATM offering. For example, companies need to file a prospectus with the SEC before they start selling shares. This document tells investors about the company and the offering. Also, the SEC requires companies to report how many shares they sell and at what price, so everything is transparent and fair.

Another important part of the regulation is the role of the broker-dealer. The broker-dealer helps the company sell the shares and must follow rules set by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). These rules make sure that the broker-dealer acts in a fair and honest way when selling the shares. They have to make sure the price of the shares is fair and that they don't do anything to manipulate the market. This helps protect investors and keeps the market working smoothly.

## What role do investment banks play in ATM offerings?

Investment banks play an important role in ATM offerings by helping companies sell their shares. They act as the broker-dealers who actually sell the shares into the market. When a company wants to do an ATM offering, they work with an investment bank to set everything up. The investment bank helps figure out how many shares to sell and at what price. They use their knowledge of the market to make sure the shares are sold at a good price and in a way that doesn't hurt the company's stock price too much.

The investment bank also makes sure that the ATM offering follows all the rules set by the SEC and FINRA. They help the company file the necessary documents and make sure everything is done correctly. This includes making sure the price of the shares is fair and that the offering is transparent. By doing this, the investment bank helps protect both the company and the investors, making sure the ATM offering goes smoothly and everyone follows the rules.

## Can you explain the process of executing an ATM offering?

When a company wants to do an ATM offering, they first need to work with an investment bank. The company and the investment bank agree on how the offering will work. The company then files a prospectus with the SEC, which is a document that tells investors about the company and the offering. This is important because it makes sure everything is clear and fair. Once the SEC approves the prospectus, the company can start selling shares.

The investment bank then starts selling the shares slowly over time, at the current market price. They do this carefully so they don't cause big changes in the stock price. The company decides how many shares to sell and when, based on what they need and what's happening in the market. The investment bank reports back to the company and the SEC about how many shares were sold and at what price. This way, everyone knows what's going on, and the company can keep raising money as needed without flooding the market with too many shares at once.

## How does the pricing mechanism work in an ATM offering?

In an ATM offering, the price of the shares is based on what's happening in the market right then. The company works with an investment bank, which sells the shares at the current market price. This means the price can change every day or even every hour, depending on how people are buying and selling the stock. The investment bank tries to sell the shares when the price is good, so the company gets a fair amount of money for them.

The company can decide how many shares to sell and when, based on what they need and what the market is doing. If the stock price is high, they might sell more shares to get more money. If the price is low, they might wait until it goes up again. This way, the company can be flexible and try to get the best price for their shares over time.

## What impact can ATM offerings have on a company's stock price?

ATM offerings can affect a company's stock price in a few ways. When a company sells more shares through an ATM offering, it can lead to dilution. This means that the total number of shares increases, so each share represents a smaller piece of the company. If too many shares are sold, this can make the stock price go down because the value of each share becomes less. Investors might also worry about dilution and sell their shares, which can push the price down even more.

However, ATM offerings are usually done slowly over time, which can help keep the stock price more stable. Instead of selling a lot of shares all at once, the company sells them little by little. This means the market doesn't get flooded with new shares all at once, which can prevent big drops in the stock price. If the company is careful about how many shares it sells and when, it can raise money without causing too much trouble for the stock price.

## How do investors typically view ATM offerings, and what should they consider before investing?

Investors often have mixed feelings about ATM offerings. Some investors might be okay with them because they see it as a way for the company to get money without causing big changes in the stock price. They might think it's good if the company uses the money to grow or pay off debts. But other investors might not like ATM offerings because they can dilute the value of their shares. If the company sells too many shares, it can make each share worth less, and that can make the stock price go down. So, investors need to think about whether the company is being smart about how many shares it sells.

Before investing in a company that's doing an ATM offering, investors should look at a few things. First, they should check if the company has a good reason for needing the money. If the company is using it to grow or do something that will make it more valuable, that's usually a good sign. Second, investors should see how the company is doing overall. If the company is doing well and the stock price is strong, an ATM offering might not be a big problem. But if the company is struggling, the offering could make things worse. Lastly, investors should think about how much dilution might happen. If the company sells a lot of shares, it could hurt the stock price, so it's important to keep an eye on that.

## What are some notable examples of successful or controversial ATM offerings in recent years?

One notable example of a successful ATM offering is from the biotech company Moderna. In 2020, Moderna used an ATM offering to raise money for its COVID-19 vaccine development. They sold shares slowly over time, which helped them get the money they needed without causing big changes in their stock price. This was good for the company and for investors because it helped fund important research while keeping the stock stable.

A controversial ATM offering happened with the real estate investment trust (REIT) Vornado Realty Trust in 2021. Vornado used an ATM offering to sell shares and raise money, but some investors were unhappy. They worried that the company was selling too many shares, which could dilute the value of their own shares. This led to some tension between the company and its investors, showing how ATM offerings can sometimes cause problems if not managed carefully.

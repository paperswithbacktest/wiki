A simple example of data normalization is the min-max scaling, which adjusts the values of a dataset to fit within the [0, 1] range:

$$
x' = \frac{x - \text{min}(X)}{\text{max}(X) - \text{min}(X)}
$$

Where:
- $x'$ is the normalized value,
- $x$ is the original value,
- $\text{min}(X)$ and $\text{max}(X)$ are the minimum and maximum values of the dataset $X$.

By ensuring that the forward-looking datasets meet these criteria, traders can integrate industrial alternative data effectively into algorithmic trading models. The ultimate objective is to ensure that these datasets align with the algorithms and strategies employed, maximizing their potential to predict market trends accurately.

# Sample industrial data - production metrics and stock prices
X = np.array([[5000, 200], [6000, 220], [6500, 210], [7000, 230]])  # Input features (e.g., prod. speed, energy used)
y = np.array([150, 160, 165, 170])  # Target (stock prices)

# Create linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict future stock price with new industrial data
new_data = np.array([[7200, 235]])
predicted_price = model.predict(new_data)

print(f"Predicted Stock Price: {predicted_price[0]}")
```

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the agricultural commodities dataset
data = pd.read_csv('commodity_prices.csv')

# Features (e.g., weather metrics, historical prices)
X = data[['temperature', 'rainfall', 'historical_price']]

# Target variable (e.g., commodity price)
y = data['current_price']

# Splitting dataset into training and testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

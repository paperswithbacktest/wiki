## What is HSBC?

HSBC is a big bank that started in Hong Kong and Shanghai a long time ago. It helps people and businesses with their money all over the world. Now, it has offices in many countries and helps people save money, borrow money, and do other banking things.

The name HSBC stands for Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. It was created to help traders move money between Europe and Asia. Today, HSBC is one of the biggest banks in the world and works in places like Europe, Asia, North America, and more. It helps people from different countries with their money needs.

## What is money laundering?

Money laundering is when people try to hide where their money came from, especially if it was earned by doing something illegal like selling drugs or stealing. They do this by moving the money around in different ways so it looks like it came from a legal business or job. This makes it hard for the police or other people to find out that the money was from bad activities.

To launder money, people might put the money into a bank, buy things like houses or cars, or move it to different countries. They do this to make the money look clean and normal. Banks and governments try to stop money laundering by watching for strange money movements and making rules that people have to follow. But it's still a big problem because people keep finding new ways to hide their money.

## When did the HSBC money laundering controversy occur?

It was a big problem because people found out that HSBC, a huge bank, was not doing enough to stop criminals from using it to hide their dirty money.

Because of this, HSBC got into a lot of trouble. They had to pay a big fine of $1.9 billion to the U.S. government. This was one of the biggest fines ever for a bank. HSBC said they were sorry and promised to do better at stopping money laundering. They made new rules and hired more people to watch for bad money movements.

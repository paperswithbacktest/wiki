By utilizing vast amounts of financial data, algorithms can execute trades at speeds and frequencies that are beyond human capability. 

The primary advantage of [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) is its ability to execute orders at high speed and with precision, significantly surpassing the capabilities of manual trading. This speed ensures that traders can capitalize on minute market movements that might be missed by manual trading. Additionally, algorithmic trading minimizes human error and bias, leading to more consistent and disciplined trading. One of the strategic benefits of algo trading is the capacity for exhaustive [backtesting](/wiki/backtesting). Traders can test their algorithms against historical data to validate their performance before deploying them in live markets. This backtesting helps identify potential weaknesses and allows for optimization of trading strategies.

However, algorithmic trading is not without its challenges. One of the main drawbacks is the issue of latency, which refers to the delay between the generation of a trading signal by an algorithm and the actual execution of the trade in the market. High-frequency trading, in particular, requires minimal latency to be effective. Another limitation is the reliance on historical data; while backtesting is beneficial, it inherently depends on the assumption that past market behavior will predict future trends. This reliance can lead to models that perform well in backtesting but falter in real-world scenarios due to changes in market dynamics.

In essence, while algorithmic trading offers substantial benefits in terms of speed, accuracy, and strategy testing, it also necessitates careful consideration of its limitations, including latency and the assumptions underlying model backtesting.

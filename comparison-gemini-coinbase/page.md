The prices might not be as good as on Coinbase because there are fewer people trading. But Gemini is still a trusted platform, and it's good for people who want a more professional and straightforward trading experience.

## What advanced trading features does Gemini offer that Coinbase might not?

Gemini has a special platform called Gemini ActiveTrader that gives you more advanced tools for trading. This platform lets you see detailed charts and use different types of orders, like limit orders and stop orders, which can help you trade more smartly. You can also use something called an API, which lets you connect your trading to other computer programs. This is really helpful if you're a serious trader who wants to do a lot of trading quickly and efficiently.

Coinbase also has an advanced platform called Coinbase Pro, but Gemini ActiveTrader has some features that Coinbase Pro might not have. For example, Gemini lets you do something called block trading, where you can trade big amounts of cryptocurrencies without affecting the market price too much. This is good if you're trading a lot of money. Also, Gemini has a tool called Gemini Custody, which is a very secure way to store your cryptocurrencies, something that might be more advanced than what Coinbase offers.

Gemini also lets you stake certain cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Tezos, which helps keep the blockchain running and gives you rewards.

Coinbase is also trying to help its users get into DeFi. They have a feature called Coinbase Earn, where you can learn about new cryptocurrencies and get some for free by watching videos and taking quizzes. This is a fun way to get into DeFi. Coinbase also lets you stake cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Tezos, which is another way to be part of DeFi. They are working on adding more DeFi services, but like Gemini, they do it in a way that's still controlled by Coinbase, so it's not as open as some other DeFi platforms out there.

Sentiment Trading refers to strategies based on trader behavior. It involves using sentiment indicators to get a clear picture of the mood of the stock market. These strategies are based on investors' perceptions and reactions to market events.

# Why Sentiment Trading is crucial to algo trading?

The essence of sentiment trading lies in its ability to predict market movements based on investor psychology. By understanding market sentiment, traders can anticipate trends and adjust their strategies accordingly.

# Key indicators for measuring market sentiment

## VIX

Known as the Fear Index, the VIX is based on options prices. An increase in VIX indicates a greater need for insurance in the market, a sign of rising volatility.

## High-Low Index

This index compares the number of stocks hitting 52-week highs with the number hitting 52-week lows. This helps to understand whether the market is bearish or bullish.

## The Bullish Percentage Index (BPI):

The BPI measures the number of stocks with bullish patterns based on point and figure charts. A neutral market has a bullish percentage of around 50%.

## Moving averages

Investors generally use 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs) to determine market sentiment.

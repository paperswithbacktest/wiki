## What is the Flat Dollar?

The Flat Dollar is a type of digital currency that is designed to be stable and easy to use. Unlike other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can have big changes in value, the Flat Dollar is meant to stay at the same value. This makes it good for everyday buying and selling because people know how much it will be worth.

The Flat Dollar is usually tied to a real-world currency, like the US dollar. This means that for every Flat Dollar in use, there is a real US dollar kept in a bank somewhere.

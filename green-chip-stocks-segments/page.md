                     'financial_growth': [1.5, 2.0, 1.8, 2.5],
                     'stock_price': [120, 140, 160, 180]})

# Feature and target extraction
X = data[['esg_score', 'financial_growth']]
y = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1])  # Binary target: Buy/Not Buy

# Model training
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X, y)

# Predictive analysis
new_data = pd.DataFrame({'esg_score': [85], 'financial_growth': [2.3]})
prediction = model.predict(new_data)
```

This pseudocode exemplifies how machine learning can be applied to assess investment opportunities in green stocks based on ESG scores and financial growth.

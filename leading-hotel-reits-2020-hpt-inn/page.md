## What is a REIT and how does it function in the hotel industry?

A REIT, or Real Estate Investment Trust, is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate. It's like a big pool of money from many investors that is used to buy properties. REITs are popular because they allow people to invest in real estate without having to buy a whole building themselves. They also have to pay out most of their income as dividends to shareholders, which can be attractive for people looking for regular income.

In the hotel industry, a REIT might own several hotels and lease them to hotel operators who run the day-to-day business. This way, the REIT earns money from the rent paid by the hotel operators. The hotel operators, on the other hand, focus on providing great service to guests without worrying about owning the building. This setup can be good for both sides because the REIT gets steady rental income, and the hotel operators can use their skills to make the hotels successful.

## What are the key differences between HPT and INN as hotel REITs?

HPT, or Hospitality Properties Trust, and INN, or Summit Hotel Properties, are both hotel REITs, but they have some key differences. HPT owns a diverse portfolio of hotels and also invests in travel centers and wellness centers. This means HPT spreads its investments across different types of properties, which can help balance risk. On the other hand, INN focuses mainly on owning upscale hotels in the upper midscale and upscale segments. INN's strategy is to target specific markets and hotel types that they believe will perform well.

Another difference is how they manage their properties. HPT often leases its hotels to third-party operators who run the day-to-day operations. This means HPT earns money from rent and doesn't have to worry about managing the hotels directly. INN, however, tends to have more hands-on management. They work closely with hotel brands and management companies to ensure their properties are run efficiently and meet high standards. This approach can lead to better control over the guest experience and potentially higher profits, but it also means more direct involvement in operations.

## How did HPT perform financially in 2020?

In 2020, HPT faced big challenges because of the global health crisis. The hotel industry was hit hard as fewer people traveled, and many hotels had to close or operate with fewer guests. HPT's revenue dropped a lot that year. They had to work with their hotel operators to adjust leases and find ways to keep their business going. Despite these challenges, HPT tried to keep paying dividends to its investors, but the amount was lower than in previous years.

Even with the difficulties, HPT managed to keep its business running. They focused on taking care of their properties and working closely with their tenants. HPT also looked for new ways to make money, like investing more in travel centers and wellness centers. By the end of 2020, HPT was still standing, but it was clear that the road to recovery would take time and effort.

## What was the financial performance of INN in 2020?

## What is a comparative overview of INN and HPT?

Both Summit Hotel Properties (INN) and Hospitality Properties Trust (HPT) are significant entities within the hotel REIT sector, each characterized by diverse property portfolios that cater to different market segments.

Summit Hotel Properties (INN) specializes in owning upscale and upper-midscale hotels, strategically located in densely populated urban areas that attract significant business and leisure visitors. Their properties are typically found in cities or regions with robust economic activity, where there is a consistent high demand for hotel accommodation. This strategic positioning allows INN to capitalize on both business and leisure travel, thereby ensuring steady revenue streams and maximizing occupancy rates. INN’s portfolio consists of properties under well-regarded brands, contributing to their credibility and attracting a loyal customer base, thus enhancing their market presence and growth potential.

Hospitality Properties Trust (HPT), known today as Service Properties Trust (SVC), differentiates itself with a broader investment strategy that encompasses a wide variety of property types. HPT focuses on high-end franchises, including globally recognized brands such as Marriott and Hyatt. This diversification reduces risk and vulnerability to market fluctuations, as it spreads exposure across various geographic locations and market segments. HPT thrives on luxury and high-quality services, leveraging brand reputation to achieve higher prices per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge in the hospitality sector.

Performance analysis of INN and HPT often employs key metrics like Funds from Operations (FFO) and market occupancy rates. FFO is a critical measure used by REITs to evaluate operating performance, reflecting the cash generated from their real estate operations. It is calculated by adjusting net income for depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash expenses, and also typically excludes gains or losses on property sales. The formula is as follows:

$$
\text{FFO} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Depreciation} + \text{Amortization} - \text{Gains on Sale of Property}
$$

Market occupancy rates provide insights into the utilization levels of their hotel properties and are indicative of revenue potential. High occupancy rates usually mean strong demand and effective pricing strategies, which can translate into robust financial performance.

Together, these metrics offer a comprehensive view of each entity’s growth strategies and potential. While INN capitalizes on strategically placed urban properties to meet high tourism and business demands, HPT benefits from a diverse asset base across premium hotel brands, allowing flexibility and resilience in changing market conditions. Both approaches underscore their respective strengths in navigating the complexities of the hotel real estate investment landscape.

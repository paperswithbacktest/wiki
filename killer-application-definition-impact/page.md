The efficacy of a well-designed trading algorithm can be quantitatively evaluated through metrics such as Sharpe Ratio, which measures risk-adjusted return. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a better risk-reward profile, thus reflecting the algorithm's effectiveness in generating profits while managing risk.

```python
import numpy as np

def sharpe_ratio(returns, risk_free_rate=0.01):
    excess_returns = returns - risk_free_rate
    return np.mean(excess_returns) / np.std(excess_returns)

# Example usage with historical return data
historical_returns = np.array([0.01, 0.02, 0.015, -0.005, 0.03])
print("Sharpe Ratio:", sharpe_ratio(historical_returns))

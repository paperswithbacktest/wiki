## What are the fees associated with using CEX.IO?

Using CEX.IO comes with different fees depending on what you want to do. If you want to buy or sell cryptocurrencies, you'll pay a fee for each trade.

## How secure is CEX.IO and what security measures does it employ?

CEX.IO takes security very seriously to keep your money and information safe. They use strong encryption to protect your data when you're using their website.

You'll need to enter a special code from your phone, making it much harder for someone else to get into your account. Plus, they keep most of the cryptocurrencies in cold storage, which means they're kept offline where hackers can't reach them.

Another way CEX.IO keeps things safe is by checking your identity when you sign up. This is called Know Your Customer (KYC) and it helps make sure you are who you say you are. They also watch for strange activities on the platform to catch any problems early. If they see something odd, they might ask you to confirm it's really you.

For example, they follow the rules set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in the US.

# API credentials
api_key = 'your_api_key'
api_secret = 'your_api_secret'

# Set up nonce for authentication
nonce = str(int(time.time() * 1000))

# Generate signature
def generate_signature(url_path, data, secret):
    postdata = urllib.parse.urlencode(data)
    encoded = (str(data['nonce']) + postdata).encode()
    message = url_path.encode() + hashlib.sha256(encoded).digest()
    mac = hmac.new(base64.b64decode(secret), message, hashlib.sha512)
    sigdigest = base64.b64encode(mac.digest())

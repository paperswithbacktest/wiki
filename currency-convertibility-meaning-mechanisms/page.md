```python
def moving_average_cross_strategy(prices, short_window, long_window):
    short_ma = prices.rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    long_ma = prices.rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

    buy_signals = (short_ma > long_ma) & (short_ma.shift(1) <= long_ma.shift(1))
    sell_signals = (short_ma < long_ma) & (short_ma.shift(1) >= long_ma.shift(1))

    return buy_signals, sell_signals
```

## What is the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS)?

The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) is a group that helps make sure money transfers and payments between banks and countries work smoothly and safely. It was set up by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which is like a bank for central banks. The CPSS works with central banks from around the world to create rules and guidelines that help prevent problems in the financial system, like when payments get delayed or when there's a risk that one bank's failure could affect others.

The CPSS also does research and publishes reports on how payment and settlement systems are doing globally. They look at things like how new technology can make payments faster and more secure, and they share their findings with banks and governments. This helps everyone understand the risks and benefits of different payment methods and encourages improvements in the systems that handle money transfers. By doing this, the CPSS plays a big role in keeping the world's financial system stable and efficient.

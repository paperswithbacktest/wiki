Also, major shareholders can affect other parts of corporate governance, like how the company is managed and what strategies it follows. If they think the company is not doing well, they might suggest changes or even push for a new CEO.

## What are the voting rights associated with PepsiCo's shares, and how do they affect major shareholders?

Major shareholders can also talk directly to PepsiCo's top leaders and suggest new ideas or changes. So, their voting power helps them guide the company's future and make sure their interests are considered in big decisions.

## How do insider ownership and major shareholder positions correlate at PepsiCo?

Insider ownership at PepsiCo refers to the shares owned by people who work at the company, like the CEO or other top leaders. Major shareholders, like The Vanguard Group or BlackRock, own a lot of PepsiCo's stock but are not part of the company. At PepsiCo, insider ownership is much smaller compared to the shares owned by major shareholders. Insiders might own around 0.1% of the company's stock, while major shareholders own much more, like 9% for Vanguard.

Even though insider ownership is small, it still matters because it shows that the people running the company believe in its future. Major shareholders, with their big ownership, have a lot of say in what PepsiCo does. They can vote on important things and talk directly to the company's leaders. So, while insiders own less, major shareholders have more power to influence the company's decisions.

## What are the recent trends in PepsiCo's shareholder activism?

Recently, there hasn't been a lot of big shareholder activism at PepsiCo. This means that big investors who own a lot of the company's stock haven't been pushing for big changes. PepsiCo has been doing well, so most shareholders are happy with how the company is being run. They trust the board of directors and the CEO to make good decisions. Because of this, there haven't been many cases where shareholders have tried to change things at the company.

However, there have been some small actions. For example, some investors have asked PepsiCo to focus more on being good for the environment and helping the community. They want the company to do more to fight climate change and support social causes. Even though these requests are not big changes, they show that some shareholders care about more than just making money. They want PepsiCo to be a responsible company too.

## How do global economic factors influence the investment decisions of PepsiCo's major shareholders?

Global economic factors can really affect what PepsiCo's major shareholders decide to do with their investments. When the world economy is doing well, these big investors might feel more confident and decide to buy more PepsiCo stock. They might think that if the economy is growing, people will buy more of PepsiCo's products, like snacks and drinks, which could make the company's stock price go up. On the other hand, if the world economy is struggling, like during a recession, these investors might be more cautious. They might sell some of their PepsiCo stock or not buy more, because they're worried that people will spend less money on snacks and drinks, which could hurt PepsiCo's profits and stock price.

Also, things like interest rates and inflation can play a big role in these decisions. If interest rates are low, borrowing money is cheaper, and companies like PepsiCo might take out loans to grow their business. This can be good for shareholders because it might lead to more profits. But if inflation is high, it can make things more expensive for PepsiCo, like the ingredients they need to make their products. This could squeeze their profits, and shareholders might decide to sell some of their stock to avoid losing money. So, major shareholders always keep an eye on these global economic factors to decide whether to buy more, hold, or sell their PepsiCo stock.

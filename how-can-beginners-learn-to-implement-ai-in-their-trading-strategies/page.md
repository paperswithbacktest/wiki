Integrating AI into trading strategies requires a combination of knowledge in finance, programming and machine learning techniques. Here's a roadmap for beginners who want to learn how to implement AI in their trading strategies:

1. **Basic training**:
    - **Finance**: Start by understanding the basics of financial markets, financial instruments and concepts such as technical analysis and fundamental analysis.
    - **Programming**: Learn a programming language, ideally Python or R, which are widely used in quantitative trading and AI.
    - **Mathematics/Statistics**: Acquire a solid knowledge of statistics, as they are essential to understanding AI models.
2. **Introduction to AI**:
    - Take online courses on platforms like Coursera, Udemy, edX, etc. Some popular courses are those by Andrew Ng or Fast.ai.
    - Read introductory books on machine learning and AI.
3. **Practical Applications**:
    - Try creating simple predictive models using historical market data.
    - Use Python libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch.
    - Explore platforms like QuantConnect or Quantopian that provide environments for developing and testing AI-based trading strategies.
4. **Data Literacy**:
    - Learn to manage, cleanse and analyze large sets of financial data.
    - Familiarize yourself with available financial databases and alternative data sources that can be used for AI in trading.
5. **Safety and Ethics**:
    - Consider the ethical aspects of using AI, particularly with regard to data confidentiality.
    - Be aware of the risks associated with AI-based trading and be sure to test your strategies carefully before deploying them with real money.
6. **Continuing Education**:
    - The field of AI is evolving rapidly. Attend workshops, conferences and regularly take advanced courses to stay up to date.
    - Join online groups or forums dedicated to AI and trading to exchange with experts and learn from others.
7. **Avoid overfitting**:
    - One of the common pitfalls in AI-based trading is overfitting, where a model works perfectly on historical data but fails under real-world conditions. Learn to recognize and avoid this.
8. **Practice, Practice, Practice**:
    - As with any skill, the successful implementation of AI in trading requires a lot of practice and experimentation.

Finally, remember that, while AI can be a powerful tool, it does not guarantee success in trading. Careful use, combined with a good understanding of the markets and rigorous risk management, is essential.

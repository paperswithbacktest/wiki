Working in a quantitative hedge fund without being a top contender is a challenge, but it's possible with the right strategy and sheer determination. Here are a few steps and tips to optimize your chances:

1. **Develop your skills**: Even if you didn't graduate from a top school, you can still stand out from the crowd by developing essential skills. Learn programming, familiarize yourself with quantitative tools and deepen your knowledge of financial markets.
2. **Networking**: Build relationships in the industry. Try to attend conferences, workshops, and seminars on quantitative finance. Use platforms like LinkedIn to connect with industry professionals.
3. **Gain relevant experience**: Look for internships, even if they're not directly at a hedge fund. Experience in related fields can be very beneficial and can serve as a springboard.
4. **Pursue additional studies**: Consider obtaining an additional certification or degree to strengthen your resume. For example, a CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) certification can add value to your profile.
5. **Create your own portfolio**: Start trading with your own money. If you can show a solid and consistent performance, this may attract the attention of recruiters.
6. **Target smaller hedge funds**: Larger hedge funds often have more candidates and stricter selection criteria. Smaller hedge funds may be more open to considering candidates with less conventional backgrounds.
7. **Prepare intensively for interviews**: Study quantitative concepts commonly asked during interviews, practice problem solving and be prepared to explain your experience and skills concisely and convincingly.
8. **Show your passion**: Hedge funds are looking for people who are passionate about finance and problem-solving. Even if you don't have the "perfect" CV, a genuine passion and desire to learn can compensate for other shortcomings.
9. **Think long-term**: If you don't immediately land a position in a quantitative hedge fund, consider other roles in the financial sector as entry points. Once you've gained more experience and made connections, you can eventually transition to a hedge fund.
10. **Stay informed**: Follow market trends, recent quantitative finance research and hedge fund news. This shows that you're engaged and informed, which can be an advantage in interviews.

In summary, while it may be harder to get into a quantitative hedge fund without being a top candidate, with perseverance, passion and a strategic approach, it's entirely possible.

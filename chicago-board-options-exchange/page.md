## What is the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)?

The Chicago Board Options Exchange, often called CBOE, is a place where people can buy and sell options. Options are special contracts that give you the right to buy or sell something, like a stock, at a certain price before a certain date. The CBOE started in 1973 and was the first place in the world where people could trade options in a big, organized way. It's located in Chicago, Illinois, and it's a very important part of the financial world.

The CBOE helps people manage risk and make money. For example, if you think the price of a stock might go up, you can buy an option that lets you buy that stock at a lower price later. If the stock price does go up, you can make money. If it doesn't, you only lose the money you paid for the option. The CBOE also creates new kinds of options, like options on things other than stocks, such as indexes or even the weather. This helps more people use options in different ways.

## When was the CBOE founded and by whom?

The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) was founded on April 26, 1973. It was created by a group of people from the Chicago Board of Trade. The main person behind starting the CBOE was a man named Joe Sullivan. He and his team wanted to make a new place where people could trade options easily.

But the CBOE also trades other types of options. One type is index options, which are based on groups of stocks, like the S&P 500. Another type is options on exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are like baskets of stocks that you can buy and sell like a single stock. The CBOE even has options on things like interest rates and the weather. This variety helps people use options in many different ways to manage risk or make money.

Besides options, the CBOE also trades something called [volatility](/wiki/volatility-trading-strategies) products. These are based on how much the price of something might change in the future.

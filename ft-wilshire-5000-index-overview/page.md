## What is the FT Wilshire 5000 Index?

The FT Wilshire 5000 Index is a stock market index that measures the performance of almost all the stocks in the United States. It includes about 3,500 companies, even though its name suggests 5,000. This index gives investors a broad view of how the entire U.S. stock market is doing. It was created by Wilshire Associates in 1974 and is now managed by FTSE Russell.

The index is important because it shows the total value of the U.S. stock market. Investors use it to see if the market is going up or down over time. It includes big companies like Apple and small companies that you might not know. By looking at the FT Wilshire 5000 Index, people can understand the overall health of the economy and make better decisions about where to invest their money.

## How did the FT Wilshire 5000 Index get its name?

The FT Wilshire 5000 Index got its name from the company that created it and the number of stocks it was originally supposed to include. When it was first made in 1974 by Wilshire Associates, they wanted to include about 5,000 stocks to represent the whole U.S. stock market. That's why they called it the Wilshire 5000.

Over time, the number of stocks in the index changed, and it now includes around 3,500 companies. But the name stayed the same. Later, when FTSE Russell started managing the index, they added "FT" to the name, making it the FT Wilshire 5000 Index. So, the name shows where it came from and what it was meant to do, even if the actual number of stocks is different now.

## What types of companies are included in the FT Wilshire 5000 Index?

The FT Wilshire 5000 Index includes many different types of companies from all over the United States. It has big companies that everyone knows, like Apple and Microsoft. These are called large-cap companies because they have a big value in the stock market. But it also includes smaller companies that you might not have heard of. These are called small-cap companies and they can be from different industries like technology, healthcare, or manufacturing.

The index tries to show what's happening in the whole U.S. stock market. So, it includes companies from many different sectors. This means you can find companies that make things, companies that provide services, and companies that do other kinds of business. By including all these different types of companies, the FT Wilshire 5000 Index gives a good picture of how the entire U.S. economy is doing.

## How is the FT Wilshire 5000 Index calculated?

The FT Wilshire 5000 Index is calculated by adding up the total market value of all the companies in the index. The market value of a company is found by multiplying the number of its shares by the price of each share. So, if a company has 1 million shares and each share costs $10, its market value is $10 million. The index adds up these market values for all the companies included in it.

To keep the index fair over time, it uses a method called "float-adjusted market capitalization." This means it only counts the shares that are available for the public to buy and sell, not the shares that are owned by the company itself or by big investors who aren't likely to sell them. This way, the index shows a more accurate picture of what's happening in the market. Every time the stock prices change, the index gets updated to show the new total market value of all the companies.

## What is the significance of the FT Wilshire 5000 Index in the financial market?

The FT Wilshire 5000 Index is really important in the financial market because it shows how the whole U.S. stock market is doing. It includes almost every company in the U.S., from big ones like Apple to small ones you might not know. This makes it a good way to see the overall health of the economy. If the index goes up, it usually means the economy is doing well. If it goes down, it might mean the economy is having problems.

Investors use the FT Wilshire 5000 Index to make decisions about where to put their money. Because it shows the total value of the U.S. stock market, people can see if the market is growing or shrinking. This helps them decide if they should buy or sell stocks. Also, other indexes and funds often use the FT Wilshire 5000 as a benchmark. This means they compare their performance to it to see if they are doing better or worse than the whole market.

## How does the FT Wilshire 5000 Index differ from other major indices like the S&P 500?

The FT Wilshire 5000 Index and the S&P 500 are both important stock market indexes, but they are different in a few big ways. The FT Wilshire 5000 tries to include almost every stock in the U.S., which is why it has around 3,500 companies. This makes it a very broad index that shows how the whole market is doing. On the other hand, the S&P 500 only includes 500 of the biggest and most important companies in the U.S. So, while the FT Wilshire 5000 gives you a picture of the entire market, the S&P 500 focuses on the performance of the biggest companies.

Another difference is how they are used. The FT Wilshire 5000 is often used to see the total value of the U.S. stock market and to understand the overall health of the economy. It's like a big picture that includes everything. The S&P 500, though, is used more as a benchmark for how well big companies are doing. Many investors and funds compare their performance to the S&P 500 to see if they are doing better or worse than these big companies. So, while the FT Wilshire 5000 gives a broad view, the S&P 500 gives a more focused look at the market's biggest players.

## What are the historical performance trends of the FT Wilshire 5000 Index?

Over the years, the FT Wilshire 5000 Index has shown a general upward trend, reflecting the growth of the U.S. economy. Since it was started in 1974, the index has seen many ups and downs, but overall, it has gone up a lot. For example, from 1980 to 2020, the index grew by about 2,500%. This means that if you had invested $100 in the index in 1980, it would have been worth around $2,600 by 2020. The index has gone through different periods of growth, like during the tech boom of the late 1990s, and times of decline, like during the financial crisis of 2008.

The FT Wilshire 5000 Index has also shown how the stock market can be affected by big events. For example, during the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s, the index went up a lot because of the excitement about internet companies. But when the bubble burst, the index fell sharply. Another big event was the global financial crisis in 2008, when the index dropped by about 40% in just over a year. However, it recovered over time, showing the resilience of the U.S. market. More recently, the index faced challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 but bounced back strongly, highlighting the market's ability to recover from major setbacks.

## How can investors use the FT Wilshire 5000 Index to gauge market performance?

Investors can use the FT Wilshire 5000 Index to understand how the whole U.S. stock market is doing. Since the index includes almost every company in the U.S., it gives a broad picture of the market's health. If the index is going up, it means that, on average, the stock prices of most companies are increasing. This can tell investors that the economy is doing well and might be a good time to invest. On the other hand, if the index is going down, it suggests that stock prices are falling, which might mean the economy is facing challenges.

## What are the criteria for a company to be included in or excluded from the FT Wilshire 5000 Index?

A company can be included in the FT Wilshire 5000 Index if it is a U.S. company that trades on a major U.S. stock exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. The company also needs to meet certain size and liquidity requirements. Size means how big the company is, and liquidity means how easy it is to buy and sell its stocks. If a company is big enough and its stocks are traded often, it can be added to the index. The index is updated every quarter to make sure it still shows a good picture of the whole U.S. market.

A company can be taken out of the FT Wilshire 5000 Index if it no longer meets the size or liquidity requirements. For example, if a company gets smaller or if fewer people are buying and selling its stocks, it might be removed. Also, if a company stops trading on a U.S. stock exchange, it will be taken out of the index. The index managers look at these things every three months to decide if any companies should be added or removed. This way, the FT Wilshire 5000 Index stays up-to-date and keeps showing the health of the whole U.S. stock market.

## How often is the FT Wilshire 5000 Index rebalanced and reconstituted?

The FT Wilshire 5000 Index is rebalanced and reconstituted every quarter. This means it is updated four times a year, usually in March, June, September, and December. During these times, the index managers check which companies should be added or removed to make sure the index still shows a good picture of the whole U.S. stock market.

Rebalancing means adjusting the weights of the companies in the index. This makes sure that the index keeps showing the total value of the market correctly. Reconstitution means adding new companies that meet the size and liquidity requirements and taking out companies that no longer meet these rules. By doing this every quarter, the FT Wilshire 5000 Index stays accurate and useful for investors.

## What is the FT Wilshire 5000 Index?

The FT Wilshire 5000 Index, previously referred to as the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index, is a comprehensive market capitalization-weighted index encompassing a wide spectrum of the U.S. stock market. Established with the objective of capturing 100% of the investible market in the United States, the index reflects the performance of an extensive array of U.S. stocks across various sectors. Acting as a critical barometer, the index provides insights into the overall health and trajectory of the U.S. equities market.

The concept of market capitalization-weighted indices, such as the FT Wilshire 5000, signifies that components within the index are weighted according to their market values. This results in stocks with larger market capitalizations exerting a greater influence on the index's overall performance. The calculation of the index value can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Index Value} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (P_i \times Q_i)}{D}
$$

where $P_i$ represents the price of each stock $i$, $Q_i$ is the number of outstanding shares, and $D$ is the divisor used to maintain consistency over time despite changes such as stock splits or rebalancing activities.

Historically, the FT Wilshire 5000 included over 7,500 stocks at its peak, representing nearly all publicly traded equities in the U.S. This expansive inclusion made it one of the most comprehensive indices available. However, changes in market conditions and corporate activities, such as mergers and acquisitions, have led to the current makeup of approximately 3,687 stocks. This reduction illustrates the dynamic nature of the market and the ongoing evolution of the index itself.

Overall, the FT Wilshire 5000 Index serves a dual purpose: it provides investors with a macro-level view of the U.S. stock market's health while also offering a detailed representation of market segments. Its utility as a traditional benchmark makes it a valuable tool for investment analysis and strategy development.

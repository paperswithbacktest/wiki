## Early Life and Education

Aaron Levy was born and raised in the United States. Demonstrating an early aptitude for mathematics and science, Levy pursued higher education with a focus on physics and applied mathematics. He embarked on his academic journey at the University of Pennsylvania, where he completed a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Science in Physics, graduating with distinction in 2011. This rigorous program provided him a strong foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of physics.

To further augment his expertise, Levy enrolled at the University of Cambridge in 2011. There, he pursued a Master of Advanced Study (MASt) in Applied Mathematics, which offered him a comprehensive understanding of mathematical techniques applied in physical theories. This experience at one of the world's prestigious universities broadened his perspectives and prepared him for advanced academic challenges.

In 2012, Levy was accepted into Princeton University, a leading institution known for its distinguished physics department. He embarked on a concurrent program at Princeton, earning both a Master’s Degree in Physics in 2015 and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Theoretical Physics in 2017. During his time at Princeton, Levy was involved in research that contributed to the field of theoretical physics, focusing on complex problems that intersected multiple disciplines. His doctoral studies honed his analytical skills and provided a robust platform for his future career in finance.

## Career

Following the completion of his Ph.D., Aaron Levy transitioned into the financial sector, leveraging his mathematical expertise to navigate the complexities of quantitative analysis. In April 2017, he joined Goldman Sachs, a leading global investment banking firm.

Here’s a basic Python example of a moving average crossover strategy, combined with a risk management system using a stop-loss order:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Generate mock data
np.random.seed(42)
dates = pd.date_range('20230101', periods=100)
prices = pd.Series(np.random.randn(100).cumsum() + 100, index=dates)

# Simple Moving Averages
short_window = 5
long_window = 20
signals = pd.DataFrame(index=prices.index)
signals['price'] = prices
signals['short_mavg'] = prices.rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
signals['long_mavg'] = prices.rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

# Generate signals
signals['signal'] = 0.0
signals.loc[signals['short_mavg'] > signals['long_mavg'], 'signal'] = 1.0
signals.loc[signals['short_mavg'] <= signals['long_mavg'], 'signal'] = 0.0

# Risk management with stop-loss
stop_loss = 2  # Example stop-loss threshold
signals['stop_loss'] = np.where(signals['price'] > signals['price'].shift(1) + stop_loss, 1.0, signals['signal'])

print(signals.head(10))
```

This script calculates short and long-term moving averages to generate buy/sell signals and employs a basic form of risk management by using a stop-loss condition. More sophisticated systems might also track leverage ratios, liquidity risks, and counterparty risks.

Another significant technology is real-time analytics platforms. These platforms can implement complex event processing (CEP) to detect patterns and execute trades or hedge existing positions when certain conditions are met.

```python
# Example: Simple Linear Regression using Python for Demand Forecasting

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample dataset: historical sales data
data = {'Days': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'Sales': [200, 220, 250, 270, 300]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features and target
X = df[['Days']]
y = df['Sales']

# Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting sales for the next day
predicted_sales = model.predict(np.array([[6]]))

print(f'Predicted Sales for next day: {predicted_sales[0]}')
```

This code snippet demonstrates a simple linear regression model, highlighting how manufacturers could forecast sales data based on historical trends. Through these approaches, algorithmic trading principles can be effectively leveraged to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency in manufacturing.

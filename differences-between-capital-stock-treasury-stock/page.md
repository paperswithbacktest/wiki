## What is capital stock?

Capital stock is the total amount of money a company raises by selling its shares to investors. When a company decides to go public, it issues shares that people can buy. The money collected from selling these shares is called capital stock. It represents the ownership in the company and is recorded on the company's balance sheet as part of its equity.

This money is important because it helps the company grow and operate. The company can use the capital stock to buy new equipment, expand its business, or pay off debts. The value of the capital stock can change over time depending on how well the company is doing and how much investors are willing to pay for the shares.

## What is treasury stock?

Treasury stock is the term for shares that a company has bought back from investors. When a company decides it wants to buy back its own shares, those shares become treasury stock. This can happen for many reasons, like the company thinking its stock is a good investment or wanting to reduce the number of shares available to the public.

Companies keep treasury stock on their balance sheet, but these shares don't count as part of the company's outstanding shares. That means they don't get dividends and they don't have voting rights. Treasury stock can be held by the company for a long time, or the company can decide to sell or cancel these shares later on.

## How is capital stock created?

Capital stock is created when a company decides to sell shares to the public. This usually happens when a company wants to raise money to grow its business or start new projects. The company will set a price for each share and then offer them to investors. People who buy these shares become part owners of the company. The total amount of money the company gets from selling these shares is what we call capital stock.

Once the shares are sold, the money is recorded on the company's balance sheet as part of its equity. This money can be used for many things, like buying new equipment, hiring more workers, or paying off debts. The value of the capital stock can change over time, depending on how well the company does and how much investors are willing to pay for the shares.

## How does a company acquire treasury stock?

A company acquires treasury stock by buying back its own shares from investors. This happens when the company decides it wants to use some of its money to buy its own stock. The company might think that its stock is a good investment, or it might want to reduce the number of shares that are available to the public. To do this, the company will go to the stock market and buy the shares at the current market price.

Once the company buys back its shares, those shares become treasury stock. These shares are kept on the company's balance sheet, but they don't count as part of the company's outstanding shares anymore. This means that treasury stock doesn't get dividends and doesn't have voting rights. The company can hold onto these shares for a long time, or it can decide to sell them back to the public or cancel them later on.

## What are the purposes of issuing capital stock?

Issuing capital stock is a way for a company to raise money. When a company sells shares to the public, it gets money that it can use to grow and operate its business. This money can help the company buy new equipment, expand into new areas, or pay off debts. By selling shares, the company can get the funds it needs without having to borrow money from a bank or other lenders.

Another purpose of issuing capital stock is to spread out the ownership of the company. When people buy shares, they become part owners of the company. This can make more people interested in the company's success and can help the company build a strong base of supporters. It also means that the original owners of the company can share the risks and rewards of running the business with a larger group of people.

## Why would a company buy back its own shares as treasury stock?

A company might buy back its own shares as treasury stock for a few reasons. One reason is that the company thinks its stock is a good investment. If the company believes its shares are worth more than what they are selling for, it can buy them back at a lower price and hold onto them. This can be a smart way for the company to use its money, especially if it thinks the stock price will go up in the future.

Another reason is to reduce the number of shares that are available to the public. When a company buys back its shares, it decreases the total number of shares that are out there. This can make the remaining shares more valuable because there are fewer of them. It can also make the company look more attractive to investors because it shows that the company is willing to invest in itself. Plus, buying back shares can be a way for the company to return money to its shareholders without paying dividends.

## How does capital stock affect a company's financial statements?

When a company issues capital stock, it raises money by selling shares to investors. This money is recorded on the company's balance sheet as part of its equity. The balance sheet shows what the company owns and what it owes, and the equity part shows the money that belongs to the shareholders. So, when a company sells shares, the amount of money it gets increases the equity on the balance sheet. This makes the company look financially stronger because it has more money to use for its business.

Capital stock also affects the company's statement of changes in equity. This statement shows how the company's equity changes over time, including any money it gets from selling shares. When a company issues new shares, it adds the money it gets to the capital stock account in the statement of changes in equity. This helps investors and others see how the company is raising money and how it is using that money to grow and operate its business.

## How is treasury stock reported on the balance sheet?

Treasury stock is shown on a company's balance sheet as a negative number under the equity section. This is because when a company buys back its own shares, it is spending money to get those shares. So, the value of the treasury stock is subtracted from the total equity of the company. This shows that the company has less money available for its shareholders because it used some of its money to buy back the shares.

The balance sheet helps people see what the company owns and owes, and the equity part shows the money that belongs to the shareholders. When a company has treasury stock, it means it has fewer shares out there for people to own. This can make the remaining shares more valuable because there are fewer of them. But on the balance sheet, the treasury stock is still shown as a negative number to reflect the money the company spent to buy back those shares.

## What are the voting rights associated with capital stock versus treasury stock?

Capital stock represents the shares that a company sells to investors. When people buy these shares, they become part owners of the company and usually get voting rights. These voting rights let shareholders have a say in important decisions, like who should be on the company's board of directors or whether to approve big changes in the company. The number of votes each shareholder gets is usually based on how many shares they own. So, the more shares someone has, the more say they have in the company's decisions.

Treasury stock is different because it's made up of shares that the company has bought back from investors. These shares don't have voting rights. When a company buys back its own shares, those shares are no longer counted as part of the company's outstanding shares. This means that people who own treasury stock can't vote on company decisions. The company can keep these shares, sell them again, or cancel them, but as long as they are treasury stock, they don't give anyone the right to vote.

## How do capital stock and treasury stock impact a company's earnings per share?

When a company issues capital stock, it sells more shares to investors. This means the total number of shares goes up. Earnings per share (EPS) is the company's total earnings divided by the number of shares. So, if the number of shares increases and the earnings stay the same, the EPS goes down. This is because the same amount of earnings is spread out over more shares. But if the company uses the money from selling new shares to grow and make more money, the EPS might go up if the earnings increase more than the number of shares.

Treasury stock works the opposite way. When a company buys back its own shares, the number of shares goes down. If the company's earnings stay the same, the EPS goes up because the earnings are now spread over fewer shares. This can make the company look more profitable on a per-share basis. But if the company spends a lot of money to buy back the shares and the earnings don't go up, the overall impact on the company's financial health might not be as good as it looks just from the EPS number.

## What are the tax implications of issuing capital stock versus repurchasing shares as treasury stock?

When a company issues capital stock, it usually doesn't have to pay taxes on the money it gets from selling the shares. This is because the money is seen as an increase in the company's equity, not as income. But the people who buy the shares might have to pay taxes later on if they make money from selling the shares. If the company pays dividends to its shareholders, those dividends are usually taxable for the people who get them. So, issuing capital stock can be a good way for a company to raise money without having to worry about paying taxes on it right away.

When a company buys back its shares as treasury stock, it uses its own money to do this. The company doesn't usually get a tax deduction for the money it spends on buying back the shares. But if the company later sells the treasury stock for more than it paid, it might have to pay taxes on the profit it makes from the sale. For the shareholders who sell their shares back to the company, they might have to pay taxes on any profit they make from the sale. So, repurchasing shares as treasury stock can have tax implications for both the company and the shareholders, depending on what happens to the shares later on.

## How do changes in capital stock and treasury stock influence a company's market perception and stock price?

When a company issues more capital stock, it means it is selling more shares to raise money. This can make investors think the company is growing and needs more money to do big things. But it can also make them worried because more shares mean the company's earnings are spread out over more pieces, which can lower the earnings per share. If investors think the company is using the money well, they might buy more shares, and the stock price could go up. But if they think the company is just selling shares to cover up problems, the stock price might go down.

When a company buys back its own shares as treasury stock, it can make investors feel good because it shows the company thinks its shares are a good investment. This can make the stock price go up because there are fewer shares out there, which can make each share more valuable. But if the company spends a lot of money to buy back shares and doesn't make more money, investors might worry that the company is not using its money wisely. This could make the stock price go down. So, how investors see these changes can really affect the stock price, depending on what they think about the company's plans and future.

## What are the key differences between capital stock and treasury stock?

Capital stock and treasury stock are two distinct components of a company's equity, serving different roles and possessing varied characteristics. Understanding these differences is crucial for interpreting a company's financial standing and investment strategies.

**Equity Ownership vs. Non-Voting Shares**

Capital stock represents the equity ownership in a company. It includes shares that are initially issued to investors, providing them with rights to dividends and voting privileges at shareholder meetings. Depending on the structure, capital stock might comprise common shares, which typically offer voting rights, and preferred shares, which may offer preferential dividend payments but may have limited or no voting rights.

In contrast, treasury stock refers to shares that a company has repurchased and holds in its own treasury. These shares are effectively taken out of circulation and do not confer voting rights or the entitlement to dividends. As such, treasury stock cannot be considered as part of equity ownership by external investors; instead, it is stock owned by the issuing company itself.

**Impact on Financial Ratios**

One of the primary differences between capital stock and treasury stock lies in their influence on financial ratios. Capital stock, as recorded on the company's balance sheet, directly contributes to the equity section, impacting metrics like earnings per share (EPS). EPS is calculated as:

$$
\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income} - \text{Preferred Dividends}}{\text{Weighted Average Shares Outstanding}}
$$

Since treasury stock is subtracted from the total outstanding shares when calculating the weighted average shares outstanding, it can increase the EPS by reducing the share count denominator. However, treasury stock itself does not directly impact other ratios like debt-to-equity, as it is a reduction in total equity.

**Strategic Financial Actions**

Companies may increase their capital stock by issuing new shares to raise capital. This is often done to fund new projects, pay down debt, or acquire other businesses. Issuing additional shares can dilute existing shareholders' equity but provides the company with fresh capital.

On the other hand, purchasing treasury stock—commonly known as a stock buyback—serves different strategic purposes. Companies might buy back shares to consolidate ownership, potentially reducing dilution, or to boost the market price of remaining shares. Treasury stock transactions signal to the market that the company believes its shares are undervalued.

In summary, capital stock denotes the total equity ownership available to investors, inclusive of rights to dividends and governance participation, while treasury stock consists of shares reacquired by the issuing company, devoid of voting and dividend rights. The strategic use of either can significantly influence a company's financial dynamics and investor relations.

Basic strategies may include moving average crossovers or simple [breakout](/wiki/breakout-trading) strategies, which are easier to understand and tweak. For instance, a simple moving average crossover strategy could be implemented in Python as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load trading data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_prices.csv')

# Calculate simple moving averages
data['SMA5'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
data['SMA20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Generate trading signals
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][5:] = np.where(data['SMA5'][5:] > data['SMA20'][5:], 1, 0)

# Calculate strategy returns
data['Strategy'] = data['Signal'].shift(1) * (data['Close'].pct_change())

# Output the strategy performance
performance = data['Strategy'].cumsum().apply(np.exp)
print(performance.tail())
```

As you grow in proficiency, you can advance to more complex systems, incorporating additional indicators or programming sophisticated decision-making algorithms. It is crucial to continuously test these strategies within a risk-managed framework to ensure they perform effectively under various market conditions. 

In conclusion, evaluating whether to automate requires introspection into your trading aptitude, willingness to learn, and adaptability to leverage technology while maintaining control over your trading objectives.

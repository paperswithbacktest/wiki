## GIC Overview and Structure

The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) was founded in 1981 to strategically manage Singapore's foreign reserves with an aggressive focus on maximizing returns over extended investment horizons. As one of the key institutional pillars of Singapore's economic framework, it operates alongside two significant entities: the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Temasek Holdings. Each plays a unique role in ensuring the country's financial health and economic growth.

GIC's operational structure is characterized by its emphasis on independent management yet aligned with national strategic priorities. This independent approach allows for more aggressive asset management and diverse international investments. Unlike traditional sovereign wealth funds that may operate more conservatively or with a domestic focus, GIC asserts its presence on the global stage, exploiting opportunities across various asset classes and markets.

The fund’s governance structure is designed to ensure accountability and transparency, with significant decisions requiring the approval of the President of Singapore. This structure underscores GIC's commitment to maintaining public trust and adhering to high standards of ethical practice, which is vital for managing a sizable portion of the nation's wealth.

Although GIC does not disclose detailed annual reports, it provides performance metrics spanning five to 20 years. These metrics reflect the fund's effective risk management practices and strategic allocation of assets, which have contributed to its stable performance. By maintaining a long-term focus and adhering to disciplined investment principles, GIC effectively navigates market fluctuations and economic cycles, ensuring the continued growth of its assets and the financial stability of Singapore.

## What is the Metcalf Report?

The Metcalf Report is a document that was created after a big event at Metcalf, California. In 2013, someone attacked a power station there. They cut fiber-optic cables and shot at the transformers. This made people worried about how safe the power grid is.

After the attack, a group of experts wrote the Metcalf Report. They wanted to find out what happened and how to stop it from happening again. The report talks about ways to make power stations safer. It suggests things like better security cameras and stronger fences. The report is important because it helps keep the power on and safe for everyone.

## Who authored the Metcalf Report?

The Metcalf Report was put together by a group of experts from the electric power industry. They worked together to figure out what happened during the attack on the Metcalf power station and how to prevent similar attacks in the future. The group was led by people who know a lot about keeping power stations safe.

The report was not written by just one person. Instead, it was a team effort by many people who wanted to make the power grid safer. They shared their knowledge and ideas to come up with good ways to protect power stations from attacks.

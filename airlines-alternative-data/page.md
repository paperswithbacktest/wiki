Machine learning models, such as supervised learning, can be used to predict market movements by identifying relationships between alternative data inputs and market outcomes. A basic linear regression model could be implemented in Python as follows:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample dataset
# X represents geolocation data, web traffic, etc.
# y represents market trends
X = np.array([[170, 80], [160, 65], [180, 75], [185, 85]])
y = np.array([330, 280, 340, 360])

# Splitting data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting market trends
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

This model demonstrates a simple approach to leveraging linear relationships using historical alternative data. In practice, more sophisticated models, including neural networks or ensemble methods, might be applied to handle non-linear relationships and complex data structures.

Ultimately, the integration of alternative data streams into trading algorithms offers a competitive edge by providing real-time, actionable insights.

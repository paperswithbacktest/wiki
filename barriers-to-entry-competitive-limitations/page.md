# Sample returns for three different assets
returns = pd.DataFrame({
    'Asset1': [0.05, 0.10, 0.15],
    'Asset2': [0.02, 0.03, 0.04],
    'Asset3': [0.06, 0.07, 0.08]
})

# Calculate mean returns and covariance matrix
mean_returns = returns.mean()
cov_matrix = returns.cov()

# Define portfolio weights
weights = np.array([0.4, 0.4, 0.2])

# Calculate portfolio return and risk
portfolio_return = np.dot(weights, mean_returns)
portfolio_risk = np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(cov_matrix, weights)))

print(f"Portfolio Return: {portfolio_return}, Portfolio Risk: {portfolio_risk}")
```

This example demonstrates how to calculate expected portfolio returns and risk using historical asset returns, highlighting the role of technology in optimizing trading strategies.

## What is the Crapo Bill?

The Crapo Bill, officially known as the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, is a law passed in the United States in 2018. It was named after Senator Mike Crapo, who was a key figure in its creation. The main goal of the bill was to change some of the rules that banks have to follow, especially the smaller and medium-sized ones. These changes were meant to make it easier for banks to lend money to people and businesses, which could help the economy grow.

One important part of the Crapo Bill was that it changed some rules from the Dodd-Frank Act, a law passed after the 2008 financial crisis to make banks safer. The Crapo Bill raised the threshold for banks considered "too big to fail" from $50 billion to $250 billion in assets. This meant that smaller banks didn't have to follow as many strict rules. Supporters of the bill said it would help banks serve their communities better, while critics worried it might make the financial system riskier.

However, there are also worries about the Crapo Bill. Some people think it could make the financial system riskier. By changing the rules that were made after the 2008 financial crisis, the bill might let banks take bigger risks. This could lead to another big financial problem if banks make bad decisions.

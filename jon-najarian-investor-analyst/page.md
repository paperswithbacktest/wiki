## The Birth of OptionMONSTER and TradeMONSTER

In 2005, Jon Najarian, alongside his brother Pete Najarian, initiated one of their most notable ventures by co-founding OptionMONSTER and TradeMONSTER.

It was particularly noteworthy for its browser-based approach, which facilitated seamless access without the need for software downloads.

## Innovations in Algo Trading

These innovations have proven crucial in detecting unusual market activities, thus providing traders with essential tools to gain a competitive edge. One of his most notable contributions is the Heat Seeker™ algorithm, which has become indispensable in understanding options activity.

The Heat Seeker™ algorithm is designed to identify substantial changes in trading volumes, which can indicate unusual market activities or hidden patterns that are not immediately apparent.

def moving_average_trading_strategy(data, short_window=40, long_window=100):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    
    # Create short simple moving average
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    
    # Create long simple moving average
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    
    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    
    return signals
```

This simple moving average strategy is an example of how algorithms can be structured to monitor price movements and execute trades based on predefined parameters.

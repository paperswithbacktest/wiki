        if np.random.random() > 0.1:
            return np.argmax(self.q_table[state])
        else:
            return np.random.choice(range(10))

    def update_q_table(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        # Simplified Q-learning formula
        self.q_table[state, action] = reward + 0.9 * np.max(self.q_table[next_state])

# Simulated trading run
env = MarketEnvironment()
agent = TradingAgent()

state = env.initial_state()

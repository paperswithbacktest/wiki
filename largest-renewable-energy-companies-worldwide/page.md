$$
\text{Daily Trade Limit} = \sum (\text{Volume}_i \times \text{Price}_i) \leq \text{Max Limit}
$$

In Python, this could be represented as:

```python
def is_within_daily_limit(trades, max_limit):
    total_value = sum(trade['volume'] * trade['price'] for trade in trades)
    return total_value <= max_limit

trades = [{'volume': 10, 'price': 50}, {'volume': 5, 'price': 100}]
max_limit = 1000

if is_within_daily_limit(trades, max_limit):
    print("Trading within limit.")
else:
    print("Trade exceeds daily limit.")
```

Overall, the regulatory considerations for algorithmic trading in energy markets are geared towards fostering an environment where technological advancements contribute positively to market functioning, ensuring that they are leveraged to enhance sustainability and efficiency without compromising the foundational aspects of market fairness and integrity.

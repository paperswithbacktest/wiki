## Overview of Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic trading, also known as algo trading or automated trading, involves the use of computer programs to place trades in financial markets based on pre-defined criteria such as timing, price, and volume. These programs utilize mathematical models and complex algorithms to execute trades at speeds and frequencies that are beyond human capability. The primary goal of algorithmic trading is to maximize efficiency by capturing market opportunities quickly and decisively, often resulting in significant cost reductions and enhanced profitability.

Algorithmic trading strategies are diverse, with each designed to exploit different aspects of market behavior. Common strategies include:

1. **Market Making**: This involves placing both buy and sell orders for a particular security to capture the spread, or the difference between the buying and selling price. Market makers profit from earning the bid-ask spread.

2. **Arbitrage**: Algorithmic trading in arbitrage seeks to exploit price discrepancies of identical or similar financial instruments across different markets or forms. The goal is to buy low and sell high, pocketing a risk-free profit. For example, if a stock is trading at different prices on exchanges in London and New York, an arbitrage strategy would involve buying the stock on the cheaper exchange and selling it on the more expensive one almost simultaneously.

3. **Trend Following**: Trend-following strategies focus on identifying and exploiting trends in market prices. Algorithms detect such trends and signal trades accordingly. This approach often uses techniques like moving averages and channel breakouts.

4. **Statistical Arbitrage**: This involves extensive data analysis to predict price movements based on statistical methods. It typically involves complex mathematical models to identify deviations from traditional price relationships and execute trades to profit from corrections.

5. **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: HFT strategies exploit very short-term market inefficiencies and price signals to execute a large number of trades in very small time frames. High-frequency traders often aim to capture small profits on each trade but make a substantial profit cumulatively due to the high volume of trades.

The growth of [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) has been noteworthy over the last few decades, driven by technology advancements, the proliferation of electronic trading platforms, and increasing data availability.

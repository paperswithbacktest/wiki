    def update_strategy(self, market_feedback):
        if market_feedback > 0:
            self.strategy = 'buy'
        elif market_feedback < 0:
            self.strategy = 'sell'
        else:
            self.strategy = 'hold'

    def act(self):
        return self.strategy

# Simulation of market feedback
market = [random.randint(-1, 1) for _ in range(100)]
agent = TraderAgent()

for feedback in market:
    agent.update_strategy(feedback)
    action = agent.act()
    print(f"Market feedback: {feedback}, Agent's action: {action}")
```

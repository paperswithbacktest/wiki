## What are Robinhood and E*TRADE?

Robinhood is an online trading platform that lets people buy and sell stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies without paying any fees. It was started in 2013 and is popular with young people because it's easy to use and doesn't cost anything to trade. Robinhood makes money from other sources, like interest on cash that users keep in their accounts and by lending out stocks that users own.

E*TRADE is another online trading platform that has been around since 1982. It offers a wide range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and options. Unlike Robinhood, E*TRADE charges fees for some services, but it provides more tools and research options for investors. E*TRADE is known for its user-friendly website and mobile app, making it a good choice for both new and experienced investors.

## How do the fee structures of Robinhood and E*TRADE compare in 2024?

In 2024, Robinhood still offers commission-free trading for stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies. This means you don't pay any fees when you buy or sell these investments. Robinhood makes money in other ways, like charging for things like margin trading and getting paid when they send your trades to other companies. So, if you just want to trade without paying fees, Robinhood is a good choice.

E*TRADE, on the other hand, has a different fee structure. While they also offer commission-free trading for stocks and ETFs, they do charge fees for some other services. For example, you might have to pay a fee if you want to trade options or if you need to use a professional to help you manage your investments.

That means you can buy pieces of big companies, bet on whether stocks will go up or down, and even trade digital money like Bitcoin. Robinhood is great if you want to start investing without spending a lot of money because you don't have to pay any fees to trade these things.

E*TRADE offers a wider range of investment products. You can trade stocks, options, ETFs, mutual funds, bonds, and even futures. This means you have more choices for growing your money, like investing in a bunch of different companies at once with mutual funds or putting your money into safe investments like bonds. E*TRADE might be better if you want to try different types of investments and need more tools to help you make decisions.

## How do the user interfaces of Robinhood and E*TRADE differ?

Robinhood does not have any account minimums. This means you can start investing with as little money as you want.

E*TRADE also does not have an account minimum for most of its accounts. You can open a standard brokerage account with no minimum amount. However, if you want to open certain types of accounts, like a robo-advisor account, you might need to start with a specific amount of money. For example, E*TRADE's robo-advisor service might ask for a minimum of $500 to get started. So, while E*TRADE is flexible for most accounts, some special services might need more money upfront.

Both apps are good, but they're made for different kinds of investors.

## How do the advanced trading features for experienced investors compare between Robinhood and E*TRADE?

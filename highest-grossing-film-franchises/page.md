# Calculate moving averages
short_window = 40
long_window = 100
data['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
data['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Generate trading signals
data['signal'] = 0.0
data['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['short_mavg'][short_window:] > data['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

# Review signals
print(data[['Close', 'short_mavg', 'long_mavg', 'signal', 'positions']])

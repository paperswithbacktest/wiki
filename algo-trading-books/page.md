## What is algorithmic trading and why is it important for beginners to understand?

Algorithmic trading, often called algo-trading, is when computers use math formulas to buy and sell stocks, currencies, or other financial things very quickly. Instead of people making these decisions, a computer program follows a set of rules to decide when to trade. This can happen in milliseconds, much faster than a human could ever do it. Many big financial companies use algorithmic trading because it can handle lots of trades at once and can take advantage of small price changes that happen very quickly.

It's important for beginners to understand algorithmic trading because it's a big part of today's financial markets. Knowing about it helps you see how prices can move in ways that might not make sense if you only think about human decisions. Also, if you're thinking about starting to trade yourself, understanding algo-trading can help you make better choices. You'll know that some of the price movements you see are because of these computer programs, and you can learn to work with or around them.

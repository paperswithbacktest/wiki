from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'sqft': [1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500],
    'location_score': [3, 4, 4.5, 5, 4],
    'price': [300000, 450000, 500000, 600000, 650000]
})

# Features and target variable
X = data[['sqft', 'location_score']]
y = data['price']

# Splitting the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Applying Linear Regression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

print("Predicted Prices:", predictions)
```

This code demonstrates a basic linear regression model that predicts property prices based on square footage and location score, showcasing how algorithmic approaches can aid in understanding real estate dynamics.

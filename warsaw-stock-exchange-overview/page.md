## What is the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE)?

The Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) is a stock exchange located in Warsaw, Poland. It is the biggest stock exchange in Central and Eastern Europe. People and companies can buy and sell shares of different companies on the WSE. It helps businesses get money to grow by selling parts of their company to investors.

The WSE started in 1991, after Poland changed from a communist system to a market economy. Since then, it has grown a lot. Today, many Polish and foreign companies are listed on the WSE. It is important for the Polish economy because it helps companies raise money and lets people invest in them. The WSE also has rules to make sure trading is fair and safe for everyone.

## How was the Warsaw Stock Exchange established?

The Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) was set up in 1991, right after Poland moved from a communist system to a market economy. Before 1991, there was no stock exchange in Poland because the government controlled everything. When Poland decided to change its economic system, it needed a place where companies could sell shares to the public. So, the government created the WSE to help companies raise money and to let people invest in them.

At first, the WSE was small and only a few companies were listed. But over time, more and more companies wanted to be part of it. The WSE grew bigger and became very important for Poland's economy. Today, it is the largest stock exchange in Central and Eastern Europe, with many Polish and foreign companies listed on it. The WSE has rules to make sure trading is fair and safe for everyone involved.

## What are the main indices of the Warsaw Stock Exchange?

The Warsaw Stock Exchange has several main indices that help people understand how the market is doing. The most important one is the WIG (Warsaw Stock Exchange Index). It shows how all the companies listed on the WSE are doing. Another important index is the WIG20, which tracks the 20 biggest and most liquid companies on the WSE. These companies are usually the most important ones in Poland's economy.

There are also other indices that focus on different parts of the market. For example, the mWIG40 tracks the next 40 biggest companies after the WIG20. The sWIG80 looks at the performance of 80 small companies. There are also sector-specific indices, like the WIG-Banki for banks and the WIG-Energia for energy companies. These indices help investors see how different parts of the economy are doing.

All these indices are important because they give a quick snapshot of the market. They help investors make decisions about where to put their money. By looking at the indices, people can see if the market is going up or down and which sectors are doing well or not so well.

## How does the Warsaw Stock Exchange contribute to the Polish economy?

The Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) helps the Polish economy by giving companies a place to get money. When a company wants to grow, it can sell parts of itself, called shares, on the WSE. People buy these shares, and the company uses the money to build new things, hire more workers, or start new projects. This helps the company grow and also creates jobs and helps the economy get bigger.

The WSE also helps people save and invest their money. When people buy shares on the WSE, they are investing in Polish companies. If these companies do well, the value of the shares goes up, and people can make money. This encourages people to save and invest, which is good for the economy. Plus, the WSE has rules to make sure trading is fair and safe, which makes people trust it more and want to invest more.

## What are the listing requirements for companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange?

To list on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, a company needs to meet certain rules. First, the company must have a certain amount of money, called capital. This shows that the company is big enough and stable enough to be on the stock exchange. The company also needs to have been in business for a while, usually at least two years, to show it has a good history. It must also have enough shares to sell to the public, so that many people can buy them.

Another important rule is that the company must share a lot of information with the public. This includes things like how much money the company is making, what it owns, and what it owes. This information helps people decide if they want to buy the company's shares. The company also needs to follow the WSE's rules about how it runs its business and treats its shareholders. This makes sure that everyone is treated fairly and that the company is honest about its business.

## How has the performance of the Warsaw Stock Exchange been over the last decade?

Over the last ten years, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has had its ups and downs. From 2013 to 2023, the WSE's main index, the WIG, has seen some good years and some not-so-good years. For example, in the early part of the decade, the WIG grew a lot, but then it had some tough times around 2018 and 2020. The year 2020 was especially hard because of the global health crisis, which made many people worried about their money and the economy. But after that, the WSE started to recover and even grew in some years.

Looking at the WIG20, which tracks the 20 biggest companies on the WSE, we can see similar trends. The WIG20 also went up and down over the decade. It had strong growth in the early years, but then it fell during the tough times in 2018 and 2020. After the health crisis, the WIG20 started to go up again, showing that the biggest companies in Poland were getting stronger. Overall, the WSE has been an important part of Poland's economy, helping companies grow and giving people a place to invest their money, even with all the changes over the last ten years.

## What are the major regulatory bodies overseeing the Warsaw Stock Exchange?

The main regulatory body that oversees the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, also known as KNF. The KNF makes sure that the WSE follows the rules and that trading is fair and safe for everyone. They check that companies tell the truth about their business and money, and they can punish companies or people who break the rules. The KNF also works to protect people who invest their money on the WSE.

Another important body is the Warsaw Stock Exchange itself, which has its own rules and a team that watches over trading. The WSE makes sure that all the companies listed on it follow its rules, like sharing information with the public and treating shareholders fairly. The WSE also works with the KNF to make sure everything is done right and to keep the market strong and trustworthy.

## How does the Warsaw Stock Exchange compare to other European stock exchanges?

The Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) is the biggest stock exchange in Central and Eastern Europe, but it is smaller than some of the big stock exchanges in Western Europe, like the London Stock Exchange or the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The WSE has fewer companies listed and less money traded every day compared to these bigger exchanges. But the WSE is still very important for Poland and the countries around it. It helps Polish companies get money to grow and gives people a place to invest their money.

Compared to other European stock exchanges, the WSE has been growing a lot over the last few years. It has more companies listed now than it did ten years ago, and more people are trading on it. The WSE is also working to make it easier for foreign companies to list on it, which could make it even bigger. But it still has a long way to go to catch up with the biggest stock exchanges in Europe. The WSE is trying to do this by making its rules better and working with other exchanges to share information and help each other grow.

## What are the future prospects and developments planned for the Warsaw Stock Exchange?

The Warsaw Stock Exchange is looking to grow and become even more important in the future. One big plan is to attract more foreign companies to list on the WSE. This would make the WSE bigger and more important, not just in Poland but all over Europe. The WSE is also working on making its rules better so that trading is even safer and fairer for everyone. They want to use new technology to make trading easier and faster, which could bring more people to the WSE.

Another important plan is to help more small and medium-sized companies list on the WSE. These companies are a big part of Poland's economy, and helping them grow could make the whole country stronger. The WSE is also thinking about working more with other stock exchanges in Europe. By sharing information and helping each other, the WSE hopes to become a bigger player in the European market. Overall, the future looks bright for the Warsaw Stock Exchange as it works to grow and help Poland's economy.

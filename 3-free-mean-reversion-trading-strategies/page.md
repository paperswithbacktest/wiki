## What is Mean Reversion Trading?

Mean reversion trading is a strategy based on the expectation that asset prices will revert to an average level over time. This concept suggests that prices which deviate significantly from their historical average will eventually return to that average, providing trading opportunities. Traders employing mean reversion strategies typically buy assets considered undervalued, anticipating their price will rise to the mean, and sell overvalued assets with the expectation that their price will decline.

A critical component of this strategy is accurately identifying when an asset's price has significantly deviated from its historical average. Various technical indicators can help detect these deviations, including moving averages, Bollinger Bands, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). For instance, if the price of a stock trades substantially below the average indicated by a moving average, a trader might anticipate an upward correction.

Mean reversion strategies are versatile and can be applied across different asset classes such as stocks, [forex](/wiki/forex-system), and commodities. This versatility makes mean reversion a valuable technique in diverse markets, aligning with the dynamic nature of price movements in these markets. The following Python code snippet demonstrates a simple application of a mean reversion strategy using moving averages:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Example data: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
data = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv', parse_dates=['Date'], index_col='Date')
data['20_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['50_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Simple trading signal
data['Signal'] = 0
data.loc[data['20_MA'] > data['50_MA'], 'Signal'] = 1  # Buy
data.loc[data['20_MA'] < data['50_MA'], 'Signal'] = -1  # Sell

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
```

In this example, we calculate two moving averages: a 20-day moving average (20_MA) and a 50-day moving average (50_MA). A buy signal is generated when the 20-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average, indicating a potential upward price reversion. Conversely, a sell signal is generated when the 20-day moving average crosses below the 50-day moving average, suggesting a potential downward price reversion.

In summary, mean reversion trading capitalizes on price movements that deviate from historical averages, using technical indicators to identify such opportunities across various financial instruments. Effective application of these strategies can enhance returns by systematically exploiting market inefficiencies.

## What are the Key Indicators for Mean Reversion Trading?

Bollinger Bands are widely used in mean reversion strategies to assess market [volatility](/wiki/volatility-trading-strategies) and determine potential overbought or oversold conditions. They consist of three lines: a simple moving average (SMA) in the middle, and two standard deviation bands plotted above and below the SMA. The formula for the upper and lower bands can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Upper Band} = \text{SMA} + (k \times \text{Standard Deviation})
$$

$$
\text{Lower Band} = \text{SMA} - (k \times \text{Standard Deviation})
$$

where $k$ is typically set to 2. Traders often look for price movements that touch or breach these bands as potential reversal signals.

Relative Strength Index (RSI) is another crucial indicator, serving as a [momentum](/wiki/momentum) oscillator that ranges from 0 to 100. RSI is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions, with values typically above 70 indicating an overbought state and values below 30 suggesting an oversold condition. The RSI calculation is given by the formula:

$$
\text{RSI} = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}} \right)
$$

This indicator aids traders in anticipating potential price corrections.

Moving Averages are fundamental tools in mean reversion as they smooth out price data to highlight the asset's overall direction. Simple Moving Averages (SMA) or Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) are typically used. An SMA is the average of prices over a specified period, while an EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive. Deviations from these moving averages can suggest reversion opportunities.

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is composed of two moving averages: the MACD line, which is the difference between the 12-period EMA and the 26-period EMA, and the signal line, which is the 9-period EMA of the MACD line. Crossovers between the MACD line and the signal line can provide buy or sell signals:

$$
\text{MACD Line} = \text{EMA}_{12} - \text{EMA}_{26}
$$

$$
\text{Signal Line} = \text{EMA}_9(\text{MACD Line})
$$

MACD histograms visualize this difference, helping traders identify momentum and reversal points.

Standard Deviation itself is a measure of the [dispersion](/wiki/dispersion-trading) or variability of prices around the mean. In mean reversion, high standard deviation levels can indicate high volatility and potential price reversions, while low levels might suggest stability. The calculation for standard deviation is:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \mu)^2}
$$

where $N$ is the number of observations, $x_i$ is each individual observation, and $\mu$ is the mean of these observations.

These indicators, when applied correctly, can significantly aid in identifying potential trading opportunities based on mean reversion strategies, guiding traders to make informed decisions in [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) environments.

## How to use mean reversion strategies?

Mean reversion strategies capitalize on the assumption that asset prices will revert to their historical averages after deviating significantly. A practical application involves utilizing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on hourly charts to identify buying and selling opportunities.

### Using the 50 EMA

The 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) serves as a dynamic support and resistance level. By placing more weight on recent prices, the EMA reacts more quickly to price changes than a Simple Moving Average (SMA). Traders often use the 50 EMA to spot potential reversals. When the asset price crosses below the 50 EMA, it may signal a potential uptrend reversal, suggesting a buying opportunity as the price is expected to revert to the mean. Conversely, a price crossing above the 50 EMA could indicate a potential downtrend reversal, signaling a selling opportunity.

### Integrating RSI

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) complements the 50 EMA by offering insight into whether an asset is overbought or oversold. Calculated using the formula:
$$
RSI = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + RS} \right)
$$
where $RS$ is the average of x days' up closes divided by the average of x days' down closes, the RSI oscillates between 0 and 100. An RSI above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while below 30 indicates oversold conditions.

### Practical Example

Consider an asset analyzed on an hourly chart with these indicators. 

1. **Buying Point**: When the asset's price dips below the 50 EMA and the RSI falls below 30, it suggests an oversold condition. A trader could buy the asset anticipating a price move back towards the EMA.

2. **Selling Point**: If the price exceeds the 50 EMA and the RSI surpasses 70, the asset might be overbought. The trader might choose to sell under the assumption that the price will revert back to the EMA.

### Python Example

Here's a Python snippet utilizing the `pandas` library for calculating the 50 EMA and RSI:

```python
import pandas as pd

def compute_ema_rsi(data, period=50):
    data['EMA'] = data['Price'].ewm(span=period, adjust=False).mean()
    delta = data['Price'].diff(1)
    gain = delta.where(delta > 0, 0)
    loss = -delta.where(delta < 0, 0)

    avg_gain = gain.rolling(window=period).mean()
    avg_loss = loss.rolling(window=period).mean()
    rs = avg_gain / avg_loss
    data['RSI'] = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))

    return data

# Sample DataFrame with price data
data = pd.DataFrame({'Price': [120, 122, 119, 121, 124]})
result = compute_ema_rsi(data)
print(result)
```

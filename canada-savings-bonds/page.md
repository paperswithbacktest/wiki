## What are Canada Savings Bonds?

Canada Savings Bonds (CSBs) are a type of investment that the Canadian government used to offer. They were a safe way for people to save money because they were backed by the government, which meant there was very little risk of losing money. People could buy these bonds and earn interest over time. The interest rates on CSBs were usually lower than other investments like stocks, but they were popular because they were secure and easy to understand.

The government stopped selling new Canada Savings Bonds in 2017. If you already owned CSBs before that year, you could keep them until they matured, which means until the end of their term. After 2017, people looking for similar safe investments might consider other options like Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) or government bonds like the Canada Premium Bonds. These options also offer security and a steady return, but it's important to compare the interest rates and terms before investing.

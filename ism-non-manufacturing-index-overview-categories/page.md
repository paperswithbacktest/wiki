## What is the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index?

The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, also known as the NMI, is a report put out by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the activity level of businesses that do not make physical products, like restaurants, hotels, and banks. The index is based on a survey of these businesses and looks at things like new orders, employment, and prices. A number above 50 means the non-manufacturing part of the economy is growing, while a number below 50 means it is shrinking.

The NMI is important because it gives us a good idea of how well the service part of the economy is doing. Since services make up a big part of the economy, the NMI can tell us a lot about the overall health of the economy. People who invest money, make business decisions, and set government policies often look at the NMI to help them understand what might happen next in the economy.

## Who publishes the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index?

The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index is published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). The ISM is a group that helps people who buy things for businesses. They give out information and help these people do their jobs better.

The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index comes out every month. It tells us how businesses that don't make things, like stores and restaurants, are doing. This helps people understand if the economy is growing or shrinking.

## How often is the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index released?

The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index is released every month. This means you can see a new report each month to understand how businesses that don't make things, like stores and restaurants, are doing.

The report comes out on the third business day of the month. This helps people know the latest information about the economy quickly. It's useful for people who make decisions about money and business.

## What does the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index measure?

The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index measures how businesses that don't make things, like restaurants and hotels, are doing. It looks at things like how many new orders they get, how many people they hire, and how much they pay for things. This index is made by asking these businesses about their activity and putting all the answers together.

The index gives a number that shows if these businesses are growing or shrinking. If the number is over 50, it means the businesses are doing better and growing. If it's under 50, it means they are not doing as well and are shrinking. This helps people understand how the part of the economy that doesn't make things is doing, which is important because it's a big part of the whole economy.

## What are the main components of the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index?

The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index has several main parts that help show how businesses that don't make things are doing. One big part is new orders, which tells us if more people are asking for services. Another part is employment, which shows if these businesses are hiring more people or letting people go. There's also a part about prices, which tells us if the cost of things is going up or down. These parts help give a full picture of how the service part of the economy is doing.

Another important part of the index is business activity, which is like a general check on how busy these businesses are. There's also a part about inventories, which looks at the supplies these businesses have on hand. Lastly, the index includes a part about supplier deliveries, which tells us if it's taking longer or shorter for businesses to get the things they need. All these parts together help people understand if the non-manufacturing part of the economy is growing or shrinking.

## How is the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index calculated?

The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index is calculated by asking a group of businesses that don't make things, like restaurants and hotels, about their activity. They answer questions about things like new orders, how many people they hire, and the prices they pay. Each of these parts gets a number, and those numbers are put together to make the index. The index is a number between 0 and 100. If the number is over 50, it means the businesses are doing better and growing. If it's under 50, it means they are not doing as well and are shrinking.

To get the final number for the index, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) takes the answers from all the businesses and figures out the percentage of businesses that say things are getting better, staying the same, or getting worse for each part of the index. They then use a special way to turn these percentages into a number for each part. After that, they add up all the numbers from the different parts, but they give more importance to some parts, like new orders and business activity, because they are more important for understanding how the economy is doing. This final number is the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which helps people see if the service part of the economy is growing or shrinking.

## What is considered a 'good' score on the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index?

A 'good' score on the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index is anything above 50. This means that the businesses that don't make things, like restaurants and hotels, are growing. When the index is over 50, it shows that more businesses are getting new orders, hiring more people, and doing well overall. This is a sign that the service part of the economy is healthy and expanding.

If the index is below 50, it means these businesses are shrinking. They might be getting fewer new orders or letting people go. A number below 50 is not considered good because it shows that the service part of the economy is not doing well. So, people who look at the index want to see numbers above 50 to know that the economy is growing.

## How does the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index impact the economy?

The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index is important because it shows how businesses that don't make things, like restaurants and hotels, are doing. This part of the economy is big, so when the index is above 50, it means these businesses are growing. That's good news because it means more people are working and spending money. When people spend more, it helps the whole economy grow. So, a high index number can make people feel more confident about the economy and encourage them to spend even more.

On the other hand, if the index is below 50, it means these businesses are not doing well. They might be getting fewer new orders or letting people go. This can make people worried about the economy. When people are worried, they might spend less money, which can slow down the whole economy. So, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index can affect how people feel about the economy and what they decide to do with their money.

## What are the differences between the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index and the Manufacturing PMI?

The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index and the Manufacturing PMI are both put out by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), but they look at different parts of the economy. The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index focuses on businesses that don't make things, like restaurants, hotels, and banks. It tells us about things like new orders, employment, and prices in these businesses. On the other hand, the Manufacturing PMI looks at businesses that make things, like cars and machines. It measures similar things, like new orders and employment, but for factories and manufacturing companies.

Even though they measure different parts of the economy, both indexes are calculated in a similar way. They both use a number between 0 and 100, where a number over 50 means the businesses are growing and a number under 50 means they are shrinking. However, because they focus on different sectors, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index can give us a better idea of how the service part of the economy is doing, while the Manufacturing PMI tells us more about the manufacturing part. Together, these two indexes help give a full picture of the economy's health.

## How can the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index be used for economic forecasting?

The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index is a helpful tool for people who want to guess what will happen to the economy in the future. It shows how businesses that don't make things, like restaurants and hotels, are doing right now. When the index is above 50, it means these businesses are growing, which usually means the economy will keep getting better. If it's below 50, it means these businesses are shrinking, and that might mean the economy will slow down. By looking at the index every month, people can see trends and make guesses about where the economy is headed.

People who make decisions about money, like investors and business leaders, use the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index to help them plan. If the index is going up, they might decide to invest more money or hire more people because they think the economy will be good. But if the index is going down, they might be more careful and save their money or cut back on spending. This way, the index helps them make smart choices based on what they think will happen in the economy.

## What historical trends can be observed in the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index?

Over the years, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index has shown some interesting trends. One big trend is that the index has been above 50 most of the time since it started being tracked in 1997. This means that businesses that don't make things, like restaurants and hotels, have been growing more often than shrinking. There have been times when the index went down, like during the 2008 financial crisis and the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. During these times, the index dropped below 50, showing that these businesses were struggling.

Another trend is that the index often goes up and down with the overall economy. When the economy is doing well, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index usually goes up, showing that service businesses are getting more orders and hiring more people. When the economy is not doing so well, the index goes down, which means these businesses are getting fewer orders and might have to let people go. This shows how closely the service part of the economy is tied to the health of the whole economy.

## How do global events influence the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index?

Global events can have a big impact on the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index. For example, when there's a big problem like a war or a health crisis, it can make people worried and change how they spend their money. If people are scared, they might not go out to eat at restaurants or stay at hotels as much. This means businesses that don't make things might get fewer new orders, and the index could go down. On the other hand, if something good happens around the world, like a new trade deal, it can make people feel more confident and spend more money, which can help the index go up.

Another way global events affect the index is through changes in the cost of things. If there's a problem in another country that makes it harder to get supplies, like oil or food, the prices can go up. This can make it more expensive for businesses to run, and they might have to charge more for their services. The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index looks at prices, so if they go up a lot, it can change the index. Also, if there's a big event that makes it easier to get things from other countries, like better transportation, it can help keep prices down and make the index go up.

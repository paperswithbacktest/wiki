## What is City Index and what services do they offer?

City Index is a financial services company that helps people trade different things like stocks, currencies, and commodities. They have been around since 1983 and are known for being trustworthy.

## How does City Index compare to other brokerage firms in terms of fees and commissions?

City Index charges fees and commissions that are pretty competitive when you compare them to other brokerage firms.

For example, if you're trading forex, the fee might be a small percentage of the amount you're trading, called a spread.

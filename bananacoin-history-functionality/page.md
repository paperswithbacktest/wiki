The network also uses something called cryptography, which is like a secret code that keeps your Bananacoin safe from people who shouldn't see it.

The people who help run the Bananacoin network, called miners, also play a big role in keeping things secure. They check every transaction to make sure it's real and then add it to the blockchain. If someone tries to do something bad, like use the same Bananacoin twice, the miners will catch it and stop it. This way, everyone can trust that their Bananacoin is safe and that the transactions are honest.

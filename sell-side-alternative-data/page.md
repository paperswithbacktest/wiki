import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample data loading
data = pd.read_csv('social_media_sentiment.csv')

# Feature and target variables
X = data[['sentiment_score', 'tweet_volume']]
y = data['stock_price_next_day']

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model training
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Prediction
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

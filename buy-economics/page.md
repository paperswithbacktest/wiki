    def next(self):
        if not self.position:
            if self.data.close[0] > self.sma[0]:
                self.buy()
        else:
            if self.data.close[0] < self.sma[0]:
                self.sell()

cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
# Add data feed and strategy
cerebro.run()
cerebro.plot()
```

Considering the technical requirements and compatibility with existing systems is vital. Traders should ensure that the algorithmic software can integrate seamlessly with their current trading infrastructure, including compatibility with different operating systems, brokerage APIs, and data feeds.

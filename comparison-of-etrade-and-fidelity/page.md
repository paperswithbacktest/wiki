## Overview of E*TRADE and Fidelity

E*TRADE and Fidelity are two of the most established names in online trading, each with a rich history and distinct offerings that have shaped their evolution and service portfolios. 

### History and Evolution

**E*TRADE** was founded in 1982 by William A. Porter and Bernard A. Newcomb. Originally known as TradePlus, the platform was a pioneer in online trading, offering its first service on Compuserve in 1983. By 1996, E*TRADE went public and became emblematic of the dot-com boom with its aggressive marketing and technological innovation. The brand continued to expand by acquiring companies such as OptionsHouse, bolstering its offerings in options trading and enhancing its Power E*TRADE platform to cater to both novice and seasoned traders. E*TRADE's focus has always been on empowering individual investors through technology, providing tools that simplify trading across multiple asset types.

**Fidelity Investments**, on the other hand, was founded much earlier, in 1946, by Edward C. Johnson II. As a well-established financial services corporation, Fidelity launched its online trading platform in 1995, capitalizing on the internet boom. The company introduced innovations like wireless trading in 1999 and continuously invested in technology to support an extensive range of investment products and retirement planning services. Fidelity’s approach integrates robust technology with comprehensive investor education, making it a preferred choice for both individual and institutional investors.

### Key Differences in Services and Fees

One of the most prominent differences between E*TRADE and Fidelity lies in their service offerings and fee structures:

- **E*TRADE** offers commission-free trades for US stocks, ETFs, and options, with a standard fee of $0.65 per options contract, reduced to $0.50 for high-volume traders (those trading over 30 times per quarter). E*TRADE’s suite of services is designed to support active traders, providing advanced charting and trading tools through its Power E*TRADE platform, which enhances the trading experience with risk analysis and backtesting capabilities.

- **Fidelity** also provides commission-free trading for US stocks and ETFs, boasting a competitive pricing structure that includes zero-fee index funds and generally lower fees on mutual funds compared to its peers. Fidelity’s Active Trader Pro platform stands out for its customizable trading environment and sophisticated tools for technical analysis and strategy development, which appeal to more strategic or long-term investors.

### Recent Developments

E*TRADE’s acquisition by Morgan Stanley in 2020 was a significant development, integrating E*TRADE’s powerful technology and user-friendly platforms with Morgan Stanley’s wealth management services. This acquisition aims to close the gap between full-service brokerage and cutting-edge digital trading, creating synergies that leverage Morgan Stanley’s extensive research and investment advice with E*TRADE’s robust trading platforms.

Fidelity has continually updated its platforms to include advanced features such as [artificial intelligence](/wiki/ai-artificial-intelligence)-driven insights and enhanced mobile applications. Its commitment to innovation is coupled with extensive educational resources, ensuring clients have access to comprehensive market analysis and educational tools. These developments reaffirm Fidelity's dedication to providing investors with research-driven insights and a seamless trading experience.

Both E*TRADE and Fidelity have adapted to the dynamic financial market by incorporating technological advancements that lower costs and bolster user engagement, securing their positions as leaders in the competitive online brokerage industry.

## Understanding Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic trading represents a significant shift in the operational dynamics of financial markets. At its core, [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) involves the use of computer algorithms to execute trading strategies at speeds and frequencies that are impossible for a human trader. These algorithms can be programmed to follow a set of rules for placing a trade, accounting for variables such as timing, price, quantity, and market conditions.

The importance of algorithmic trading in today's financial markets cannot be overstated. It facilitates high-frequency trading ([HFT](/wiki/high-frequency-trading-strategies)), an advanced form of algorithmic trading that executes a large number of orders in fractions of a second. This rapid execution is crucial for exploiting momentary market inefficiencies, thus providing [liquidity](/wiki/liquidity-risk-premium) and reducing transaction costs.

Key benefits of algorithmic trading include enhanced speed and accuracy, minimizing the lag between decision-making and trade execution. Such precision ensures that trades are executed at the desired price points, thereby optimizing market entry and [exit](/wiki/exit-strategy) opportunities. Moreover, algorithmic trading systematically eliminates human emotions from decision-making, addressing common trading biases such as fear and greed. This objectivity ensures consistent adherence to predefined strategies, improving the reliability and validity of trading outcomes.

Algorithmic trading is reshaping investment strategies for both individual and institutional investors by enabling more sophisticated and diverse trading strategies. For instance, algorithmic systems can simultaneously monitor multiple markets and securities, allowing for the implementation of complex strategies such as statistical [arbitrage](/wiki/arbitrage) or [market making](/wiki/market-making). Institutional investors, in particular, leverage these algorithms to manage large portfolios and maintain competitive advantage through strategic asset allocations and execution efficiencies.

The democratization of algorithmic trading tools by platforms like E*TRADE and Fidelity enables retail investors to access advanced trading techniques previously reserved for institutional players. This access allows individual investors to incorporate quantitative decision-making processes into their strategies, thus bridging the gap between retail and institutional trading capabilities.

In conclusion, algorithmic trading continues to transform financial markets by increasing efficiency and reducing costs for traders of all types. Its role in shaping modern investment strategies underscores its significance in the evolution of trading methodologies.

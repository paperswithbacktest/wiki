Between its inception and 2022, the GIU has evolved into a vital financial mechanism, impacting over 2.8 million beneficiaries by providing them with the necessary capital to succeed in a competitive market.

The GIU's model of microfinance loans is tailored to the unique needs of Indonesian SMEs, which often struggle to secure funding through traditional financial institutions, due to a lack of collateral or high perceived risk. This approach ensures that even the smallest enterprises can access finance, promote entrepreneurship and innovation, and ultimately enhance the country's economic resilience. The unit's focus on SME support is aligned with the national policy to encourage economic inclusivity and expand the formal credit market to previously underbanked sectors.

Moreover, the GIU's financial interventions are designed to complement other governmental strategies aimed at strengthening Indonesia's economic fabric, including technological advancements in financial services. By fostering a more robust SME sector, the GIU contributes not only to immediate economic benefits but also to long-term economic stability and growth, positioning Indonesia as a competitive player in the regional and global markets.

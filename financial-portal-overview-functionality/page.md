from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Example dataset: monthly expenses
data = {'Month': range(1, 13), 'Expenses': [2200, 2350, 2100, 2250, 2500, 2600, 2400, 2300, 2550, 2450, 2700, 2600]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Splitting data
X = df[['Month']]
y = df['Expenses']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict expenses in the coming month
new_month = pd.DataFrame({'Month': [13]})
predicted_expense = model.predict(new_month)

print(f"Predicted Expense for 13th month: ${predicted_expense[0]:.2f}")
```

This hypothetical script showcases how some tools might process and predict future financial conditions based on historical data. By integrating such analytical capabilities, online finance tools empower users with insights to make strategic financial decisions.

Overall, the evolution and sophistication of online finance tools continue to shape the landscape of financial management by providing accessible, efficient, and effective solutions that meet the needs of individual and business users alike.

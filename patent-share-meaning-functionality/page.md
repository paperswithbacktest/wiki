Numerous notable patents have left a profound impact on market competition and innovation within algorithmic trading. For example, some patents encapsulate pioneering trading algorithms that leverage [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning) techniques to predict market movements. These algorithms often use historical data to train predictive models, which can then identify potentially profitable trades more accurately than traditional methods.

Consider a patented algorithm that optimizes trading strategies based on predictive models. The algorithm may employ machine learning techniques such as neural networks or decision trees to predict asset price movements. Below is a simplified Python example that demonstrates the basic idea behind such predictive modeling:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# Sample historical market data (features and target prices)
X = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5], [4, 5, 6]])
y = np.array([1.2, 2.3, 3.1, 4.4])

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict prices on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```

## What is selling away?

Selling away is when a financial advisor or broker sells investments that their company does not approve or offer. This can be risky because these investments are not monitored by the company, and the advisor might not follow the rules meant to protect investors.

This practice can lead to problems for both the investor and the advisor. For the investor, the investment might be too risky or not suitable for their goals. For the advisor, selling away can result in getting in trouble with their employer or even facing legal action if something goes wrong with the investment.

## Why do financial advisors engage in selling away?

Financial advisors might engage in selling away because they believe the investments they are selling can make a lot of money for their clients. They might think these investments are a good opportunity that their company doesn't offer. Sometimes, advisors also do this because they can earn more money from these investments than from the ones their company approves.

However, selling away can be risky. It's against the rules set by their company and can lead to big problems. If the investment doesn't work out, the advisor can get in trouble with their employer or even face legal action. This is why it's important for advisors to stick to the investments their company approves and follows.

## What are the risks associated with selling away for investors?

When a financial advisor sells investments that their company doesn't approve, it's called selling away. This can be risky for investors. The main risk is that these investments might be too risky or not right for the investor's goals. Since the company doesn't monitor these investments, there's no one making sure they are safe and suitable for the investor. This means the investor might lose money if the investment doesn't work out.

Another risk is that the investor might not have all the information they need about the investment. When a company approves an investment, they usually provide a lot of details and do checks to make sure it's okay. But with selling away, the investor might not get this information, making it hard to make a good decision. This lack of information can lead to bad investment choices and financial losses.

## What are the regulatory rules regarding selling away?

Selling away is against the rules set by financial regulatory bodies like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in the United States. These rules are in place to protect investors and make sure that financial advisors only sell investments that their company has approved. When an advisor sells something that their company doesn't know about or hasn't approved, it's called selling away, and it's not allowed.

If a financial advisor is caught selling away, they can get in big trouble. They might lose their job, face fines, or even be banned from working in the financial industry. This is because selling away can put investors at risk, and the rules are there to make sure that doesn't happen. It's important for advisors to follow these rules to keep their clients safe and to keep their own careers safe too.

## How can investors identify if their advisor is involved in selling away?

Investors can spot selling away by paying attention to the investments their advisor suggests. If an advisor is pushing an investment that's not on the company's list of approved products, that could be a sign of selling away. Investors should ask their advisor if the investment is approved by their firm. If the advisor seems unsure or avoids the question, it might be a red flag.

Another way to identify selling away is by looking at the paperwork. When an advisor sells an investment, they usually have to give the investor documents that show the investment is approved by their company. If these documents are missing or if they don't mention the company's approval, it could mean the advisor is selling away. It's a good idea for investors to read these documents carefully and ask questions if something doesn't seem right.

## What should investors do if they suspect their advisor is selling away?

If investors think their advisor might be selling away, they should talk to their advisor right away. They should ask if the investment is approved by the advisor's company. If the advisor can't give a clear answer or seems unsure, that's a warning sign. Investors should also look at any paperwork the advisor gives them. If the documents don't say the investment is approved by the company, it could mean the advisor is selling away.

If investors are still worried after talking to their advisor, they should contact the advisor's company. The company can check if the investment is approved and if the advisor is following the rules. If the company confirms that the investment is not approved, investors should think about finding a new advisor. They can also report the issue to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or another regulatory body to protect themselves and other investors.

## Can selling away be legal under any circumstances?

Selling away is usually not allowed because it means a financial advisor is selling investments that their company hasn't approved. This is against the rules set by regulatory bodies like FINRA in the United States. These rules are there to make sure investors are protected and that advisors only sell safe and suitable investments.

However, in very rare cases, an advisor might be allowed to sell away if they get special permission from their company. This permission has to be in writing and the company has to closely watch the investment to make sure it's okay. But this is not common and most of the time, selling away is against the rules.

## What are the consequences for financial advisors caught selling away?

If a financial advisor gets caught selling away, they can face serious trouble. They might lose their job because their company doesn't allow them to sell investments that aren't approved. This can hurt their career a lot because it's hard to find another job in the financial industry after something like this happens.

Besides losing their job, the advisor could also face fines. These fines can be a lot of money and can make it even harder for the advisor to move on. In the worst cases, the advisor might be banned from working in the financial industry at all. This is a big deal because it means they can't work as a financial advisor anymore, which can be their whole career.

Regulatory bodies like FINRA can also take action against the advisor. They might investigate the advisor and, if they find that selling away happened, they can add a note to the advisor's record. This note can make it very hard for the advisor to find work in the future because other companies will see it and might not want to hire them.

## How can firms prevent selling away within their organization?

Firms can prevent selling away by making sure their advisors know the rules. They should train their advisors well and remind them often that selling investments the firm hasn't approved is not allowed. Firms should also have a clear list of approved investments that advisors can use. If an advisor wants to sell something else, they need to ask the firm first and get it in writing.

Another way firms can stop selling away is by keeping a close eye on what their advisors are doing. They can use special tools to watch the investments being sold and check if they are on the approved list. If they see something that's not approved, they can step in right away and stop it. By watching carefully and acting fast, firms can make sure their advisors follow the rules and keep their clients safe.

## What are some real-world examples of selling away?

One real-world example of selling away happened with a financial advisor named John. John worked for a big investment company but started selling a new kind of investment that his company didn't know about. He told his clients it was a great opportunity to make money, but it wasn't on his company's approved list. When the investment failed, John's clients lost a lot of money. The company found out and fired John, and he also had to pay big fines.

Another example is about an advisor named Sarah. Sarah was selling special real estate deals to her clients, but her company didn't approve them. She thought these deals could make her clients rich, but they were very risky. When some of the deals went bad, her clients lost money and got upset. Sarah's company investigated and found out she was selling away. They fired her, and she was banned from working in the financial industry for a while.

## How does selling away impact the reputation of the financial industry?

Selling away can hurt the reputation of the financial industry a lot. When people hear about advisors selling investments that their company doesn't approve, they start to think that the whole industry might not be trustworthy. This makes people worried about working with financial advisors because they might think they could lose money if their advisor does something wrong. It's hard for the industry to keep people's trust when stories about selling away make the news.

The financial industry works hard to make rules and watch over advisors to keep clients safe. But when selling away happens, it shows that some advisors might not follow these rules. This can make the public think that the industry isn't doing a good job of protecting them. It's important for the industry to stop selling away and show that they care about their clients' money and trust.

## What steps can investors take to protect themselves from the risks of selling away?

Investors can protect themselves from the risks of selling away by always asking their advisor if the investment they're being offered is approved by their company. If the advisor can't give a clear answer or seems unsure, that's a warning sign. Investors should also read all the paperwork carefully. If the documents don't mention that the investment is approved by the company, it could mean the advisor is selling away.

If investors are still worried after talking to their advisor, they should contact the advisor's company. The company can check if the investment is approved and if the advisor is following the rules. If the company confirms that the investment is not approved, investors should think about finding a new advisor. They can also report the issue to a regulatory body like FINRA to protect themselves and other investors.

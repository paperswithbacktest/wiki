In contrast, a GPU comprises thousands of smaller, efficient cores designed for handling multiple tasks simultaneously. This architectural design enables GPUs to process multiple threads at once, excelling in parallel processing tasks.

Parallel processing, a core capability of GPUs, involves executing multiple operations simultaneously, significantly boosting performance for tasks that can be broken into smaller, independent operations. This capability arises from the SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) architecture, allowing a single operation to be performed on multiple data points concurrently. For instance, consider matrix operations frequently used in machine learning and computer graphics:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example of vector addition using parallel processing paradigms
vector_a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
vector_b = np.array([5, 6, 7, 8])
vector_c = vector_a + vector_b
```

In this example, the vector addition can leverage the parallel processing capability of GPUs to perform the addition operation on multiple data points at once, resulting in substantial speed improvements compared to serial processing.

Beyond computational graphics, GPUs have found transformative applications in numerous industries.

This reduces the time needed to generate statistically significant results.

In Python, a simple parallel processing framework that illustrates the potential of GPU for financial computations can look like this:

```python
import numpy as np
from numba import cuda

@cuda.jit
def calculate_returns(prices, returns):
    i = cuda.grid(1)
    if i < prices.size - 1:
        returns[i] = (prices[i+1] - prices[i]) / prices[i]

# Example usage
prices = np.array([...], dtype=np.float32)  # Input historical price data
returns = np.zeros(prices.size - 1, dtype=np.float32)
calculate_returns[blockspergrid, threadsperblock](prices, returns)
```

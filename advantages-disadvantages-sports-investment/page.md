```python
import backtrader as bt

# Create a strategy class
class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    def __init__(self):
        self.sma = bt.indicators.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data, period=15)

    def next(self):
        if self.data.close > self.sma:
            self.buy()
        elif self.data.close < self.sma:
            self.sell()

# Backtest the strategy
cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
cerebro.addstrategy(MyStrategy)
cerebro.run()
```

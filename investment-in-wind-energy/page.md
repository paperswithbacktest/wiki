import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample dataset: wind speed (X) and corresponding energy output (y)
X = np.array([5, 10, 15, 20, 25]).reshape(-1, 1)  # Wind speed in m/s
y = np.array([50, 150, 200, 300, 350])  # Energy output in kW

# Create and train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict energy output for a new wind speed
new_speed = np.array([[18]])
predicted_output = model.predict(new_speed)
print(f'Predicted energy output for wind speed 18 m/s: {predicted_output[0]:.2f} kW')
```

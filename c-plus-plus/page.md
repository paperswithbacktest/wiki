```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>

double calculateMovingAverage(const std::vector<double>& prices, int period) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < period; ++i) {
        sum += prices[i];
    }
    return sum / period;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<double> testPrices = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int period = 3;
    double expectedAverage = 20; // (10+20+30)/3

    assert(calculateMovingAverage(testPrices, period) == expectedAverage);
    std::cout << "Test passed!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Beyond unit testing, performance testing and benchmarking evaluate system responsiveness and efficiency under realistic market conditions.

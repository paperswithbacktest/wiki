You can choose from pre-made portfolios or build your own. M1 Finance also offers features like automatic investing and borrowing against your investments. It's designed to be easy to use, even if you're new to investing.

Betterment is another platform that helps people invest and manage their money. It focuses on creating diversified portfolios made up of ETFs. Betterment uses technology to manage your investments automatically, adjusting them to keep your portfolio balanced. It also offers tools to help you plan for retirement and save for other goals. Like M1 Finance, Betterment aims to make investing simple and accessible for everyone.

## How do M1 Finance and Betterment cater to beginner investors?

M1 Finance makes investing easy for beginners by letting them choose from ready-made portfolios or create their own. These portfolios are called "pies," and they can be filled with stocks and ETFs. Beginners can start with expert-made pies that match their goals, like saving for a house or retirement. M1 Finance also has a feature called "auto-invest," which automatically puts money into your pies at set times. This helps beginners invest without having to think about it every day.

Betterment is also great for people new to investing. It creates a diversified portfolio of ETFs for you based on your goals and how much risk you want to take. Betterment does all the work of managing your investments, so you don't have to worry about it. It also has tools that help you plan for the future, like retirement calculators. This makes it easy for beginners to start investing and stay on track with their financial goals.

## What are the fee structures for M1 Finance and Betterment?

M1 Finance has a simple fee structure. If you use their basic service, it's free. You can invest in stocks and ETFs without paying any management fees. But if you want to use their premium service, called M1 Plus, it costs $10 a month or $95 a year. M1 Plus gives you extra features like borrowing against your investments and getting a higher [interest rate](/wiki/interest-rate-trading-strategies) on your cash.

Betterment also has two types of accounts with different fees. Their basic account, called Betterment Digital, charges a low fee of 0.25% per year on the money you invest. This fee is taken out of your account automatically. If you want more help and advice, you can get Betterment Premium, which costs 0.40% per year. Betterment Premium includes unlimited access to financial experts who can help you with your investments and plans.

## How do the investment options differ between M1 Finance and Betterment?

M1 Finance gives you a lot of freedom to pick what you want to invest in. You can choose from a big list of stocks and ETFs. They have ready-made portfolios called "pies" that are made by experts, but you can also make your own pie. This means you can mix and match stocks and ETFs to fit what you want. M1 Finance is good if you want to pick your own investments or if you want to use expert choices but still have control.

Betterment is different because it picks your investments for you. It uses ETFs to make a portfolio that matches your goals and how much risk you want to take. You don't get to choose the specific ETFs; Betterment does it all for you. This makes it easier because you don't have to think about which ETFs to pick. Betterment is good if you want someone else to manage your investments and keep them balanced.

## What are the minimum investment requirements for each platform?

M1 Finance is great for people who don't have a lot of money to start with. You can begin investing with no minimum amount. This means you can start with whatever you have, even if it's just a little bit. It's easy for anyone to get started and begin growing their money.

Betterment also makes it easy to start investing, but it has a small minimum. For their basic account, Betterment Digital, you need at least $10 to start. If you want their premium service, Betterment Premium, you need at least $100,000. This means Betterment might be a bit harder to start with if you don't have much money, but it's still not too high for most people.

## How do M1 Finance and Betterment handle tax strategies like tax-loss harvesting?

M1 Finance focuses on making investing easy and letting you pick your own investments, but it doesn't include extra services like tax-loss harvesting.

M1 Finance has a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, especially for beginners. When you log in, you see your pies, which are your investment portfolios, right away. You can easily add money to your pies or change them by dragging and dropping stocks and ETFs. M1 Finance also has a mobile app that works well and lets you manage your investments on the go. The interface is simple and clean, but it doesn't have as many advanced features as some other platforms. If you want to do things like tax-loss harvesting, you'll need to look elsewhere.

Betterment's interface is also designed to be easy to use, but it focuses more on automation and planning. When you log in, you see your overall portfolio and how it's doing.

## How do the performance histories of M1 Finance and Betterment compare?

M1 Finance's performance depends a lot on what you choose to invest in. Since you can pick your own stocks and ETFs or use expert-made pies, how well your investments do can be different from someone else's. M1 Finance doesn't share one overall performance number because everyone's portfolio is different. But if you choose well and keep investing regularly, you can do well over time. It's important to remember that past performance doesn't tell you what will happen in the future, so you need to keep an eye on your investments.

Betterment, on the other hand, gives you a more straightforward performance history because it picks your investments for you. They use ETFs to make a balanced portfolio, and they share how these portfolios have done over time. Betterment's performance can be easier to track because everyone with the same risk level and goals will have similar investments. Like M1 Finance, past performance at Betterment doesn't promise future results, but their automated approach can help you stay on track and make adjustments to keep your portfolio doing well.

## What is contango?

Contango is a situation in the futures market where the price of a futures contract is higher than the expected future spot price of the underlying asset. This means that if you want to buy a futures contract, you will pay more now than what the asset is expected to be worth when the contract expires. Contango often happens when people expect the price of the asset to go up over time due to factors like storage costs or interest rates.

For example, if the current price of oil is $50 per barrel, but the futures contract for oil in six months is trading at $55 per barrel, the market is in contango. This difference in price can be because it costs money to store oil, and those costs are included in the futures price. Investors need to be aware of contango because it can affect their returns, especially if they are rolling over futures contracts.

## What is backwardation?

Backwardation is the opposite of contango. It happens in the futures market when the price of a futures contract is lower than the expected future spot price of the underlying asset. This means you can buy a futures contract for less than what the asset is expected to be worth when the contract expires. Backwardation often occurs when there is a high demand for the asset right now, or when people expect the price to go down in the future.

For example, if the current price of wheat is $5 per bushel, but the futures contract for wheat in three months is trading at $4 per bushel, the market is in backwardation. This could happen because people need wheat right away, maybe because of a shortage, and they are willing to pay more now than later. Investors need to know about backwardation because it can affect how much money they make, especially if they are buying and selling futures contracts regularly.

## How can you identify contango in a futures market?

To identify contango in a futures market, you need to compare the price of a futures contract with the expected future spot price of the asset. If the futures contract price is higher than what people think the asset will be worth when the contract expires, then the market is in contango. For example, if oil is currently priced at $50 per barrel, but the futures contract for oil in six months is trading at $55 per barrel, the market is in contango.

You can also look at the futures curve, which is a graph showing the prices of futures contracts over different time periods. In a contango situation, the futures curve will be upward sloping, meaning that the prices get higher the further out in time you go. This upward slope shows that it costs more to buy the asset in the future than it does now, which is a key sign of contango.

## How can you identify backwardation in a futures market?

To identify backwardation in a futures market, you need to compare the price of a futures contract with what people think the asset will be worth in the future. If the futures contract price is lower than the expected future spot price, then the market is in backwardation. For example, if wheat is currently priced at $5 per bushel, but the futures contract for wheat in three months is trading at $4 per bushel, the market is in backwardation.

You can also look at the futures curve to spot backwardation. The futures curve is a graph that shows the prices of futures contracts at different times. In a backwardation situation, the futures curve will be downward sloping, meaning that the prices get lower the further out in time you go. This downward slope shows that it costs less to buy the asset in the future than it does now, which is a clear sign of backwardation.

## What are the primary causes of contango?

Contango happens when the price of a futures contract is higher than what people think the asset will be worth in the future. One big reason for this is the cost of holding onto the asset. For things like oil or grains, it costs money to store them, and these costs get added to the futures price. Also, if you buy a futures contract, you might have to pay interest on the money you use to buy it, which can make the futures price go up.

Another reason for contango is when people expect the price of the asset to go up over time. This can happen if there's a lot of demand for the asset in the future, or if there are fewer people selling it. When people think the price will be higher later, they are willing to pay more for a futures contract now, which leads to contango.

## What are the primary causes of backwardation?

Backwardation happens when the price of a futures contract is lower than what people think the asset will be worth in the future. One main reason for this is when there's a lot of demand for the asset right now. If people need the asset urgently, like during a shortage, they will pay more for it now than they would for a futures contract. This makes the current price higher than the futures price, which leads to backwardation.

Another reason for backwardation is when people expect the price of the asset to go down over time. If everyone thinks the price will be lower later, they won't want to pay as much for a futures contract. This can happen if there's going to be more of the asset available in the future, or if demand is expected to drop. When people expect lower prices later, it pushes the futures price down below the current price, causing backwardation.

## How do storage costs affect contango?

Storage costs are a big reason why contango happens. When you have to store things like oil or grains, it costs money. These costs get added to the price of a futures contract. So, if it costs more to keep the asset until the future date, the futures price will be higher than what people think the asset will be worth when the contract expires. This difference between the futures price and the expected future spot price is what we call contango.

For example, if it costs $1 per barrel to store oil for a month, and you want to buy oil for delivery in six months, you have to pay for six months of storage. If the current price of oil is $50 per barrel, but the futures contract for oil in six months is $56 per barrel, the extra $6 is because of storage costs. This shows how storage costs can push the futures price higher, leading to contango.

## How do interest rates influence contango and backwardation?

Interest rates can make contango happen. When you buy a futures contract, you might need to borrow money to do it. The interest you have to pay on that borrowed money gets added to the price of the futures contract. So, if interest rates are high, the cost of holding onto the futures contract goes up. This makes the futures price higher than what people think the asset will be worth in the future, which is contango. 

Interest rates can also affect backwardation. If interest rates are low, it's cheaper to borrow money to buy a futures contract. This can make the futures price lower than what people expect the asset to be worth later. When the futures price is lower than the expected future spot price, that's backwardation. So, low interest rates can help cause backwardation by making it cheaper to hold onto futures contracts.

## What are the implications of contango for investors?

Contango can make it harder for investors to make money, especially if they are trading futures contracts. When the futures price is higher than what the asset will be worth later, investors who buy and hold futures contracts might lose money when the contract expires. They have to pay more for the futures contract than what they get when they sell the asset. This can happen over and over if they keep rolling over their futures contracts, which means buying new ones when the old ones expire.

But contango isn't always bad for investors. Some people can make money from it by doing something called "cash and carry arbitrage." This means they buy the asset now, store it, and then sell it later when the futures contract expires. If the profit from selling the asset later is more than the cost of storing it and the interest they have to pay, they can make money. So, while contango can be a challenge for some investors, others can use it to their advantage if they know what they're doing.

## What are the implications of backwardation for investors?

Backwardation can be good news for investors who are holding futures contracts. When the futures price is lower than what the asset will be worth later, investors can buy the futures contract cheap and then sell the asset for more money when the contract expires. This means they can make a profit. If investors keep buying and selling futures contracts in a backwardation market, they might keep making money each time they roll over their contracts.

But backwardation isn't always great for everyone. Some investors might have a hard time if they need to buy the asset now but the current price is too high because of backwardation. They might have to pay more for the asset right away than they would if they waited. So, while backwardation can help some investors make money, it can make things harder for others who need the asset right now.

## How can traders take advantage of contango and backwardation?

Traders can make money from contango by doing something called "cash and carry arbitrage." This means they buy the asset now, pay to store it, and then sell it later when the futures contract expires. If the money they make from selling the asset later is more than what they spent on storage and interest, they come out ahead. So, in a contango market, traders can use the difference between the high futures price and the lower expected future spot price to their advantage.

Traders can also profit from backwardation by buying futures contracts at a low price and then selling the asset at a higher price when the contract expires. This is good for traders who like to buy and sell futures contracts often because they can keep making money each time they roll over their contracts. But traders need to be careful because if they need the asset right away, they might have to pay more now than they would if they waited, which can be a downside of backwardation.

## What are the long-term economic impacts of persistent contango or backwardation?

When contango sticks around for a long time, it can change how people act in the market. People might start storing more of the asset because they can make money from the difference between the high futures price and the lower future spot price. This can lead to more storage costs and might make the asset less available right now. If lots of people do this, it can mess with the supply and demand of the asset, making prices go up or down in ways that are hard to predict. This can be tough for businesses that need the asset right away because they might have to pay more for it.

If backwardation lasts a long time, it can also shake things up in the market. People might rush to buy the asset now because they think it will be worth more later. This can make the price of the asset go up a lot right away, which can be good for people selling the asset now but bad for people who need it later. Over time, this can lead to big swings in the price of the asset, which can make it hard for businesses to plan and can affect the overall economy. Both contango and backwardation can lead to changes in how people use and store assets, which can have big effects on the market and the economy.

## What is Contango?

Contango refers to a market condition where the future prices of a commodity are higher than the spot price at a given point in time. This phenomenon arises when market participants expect the asset's value to increase over time. The expectation could be driven by several factors, including storage costs, financing, insurance, and inflation projections. Investors anticipating higher future demand or lower future supply also contribute to this pricing condition.

Storage costs are a primary driver of contango, particularly in commodity markets. When holding a physical commodity such as oil, grain, or metals, there are associated costs for storage, insurance, and deterioration risk, which need to be factored into futures pricing. The cost of [carry](/wiki/carry-trading), $C$, which indicates the cost of holding an asset over time, can be expressed through the formula:

$$
F = S(1 + C)
$$

where $F$ is the futures price, $S$ is the current spot price, and $C$ is the cost of carry over the period.

Inflation expectations also affect futures prices. If inflation is anticipated to rise, future purchasing power diminishes, leading investors to require higher future prices to compensate for the decreased value of money. This adjustment manifests as contango, with the futures prices indicating expected inflation-adjusted valuations.

While storage costs and inflation expectations frequently result in contango, this condition is generally perceived as a typical state in many commodity markets. It reflects a market equilibrium where holders of the commodity are compensated for the opportunity cost and inconvenience of deferring consumption or sale until a future date.

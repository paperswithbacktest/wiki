## What are Empower and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services?

Empower also has financial advisors who can help you plan for things like retirement or buying a house. You can use their app or website to check your finances anytime.

Vanguard Personal Advisor Services is another service that helps you with your money, but it focuses a lot on investing. It uses technology and human advisors to give you personalized advice based on your goals and how much risk you're willing to take.

Empower charges a fee based on the total amount of money you have them manage. If you have less than $1 million, the fee is 0.89% of your assets each year. If you have more than $1 million, the fee goes down to 0.79%. This means if you have $100,000 with Empower, you would pay $890 in fees each year. The fees are taken out of your account automatically.

Vanguard Personal Advisor Services has a different approach. They charge a flat fee of 0.30% of your assets per year, no matter how much money you have with them.

Python code snippet for backtesting:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def backtest_strategy(data, strategy):
    # Example: Calculate returns and strategy performance
    data['returns'] = data['price'].pct_change()
    data['strategy'] = data['returns'] * strategy

    # Calculate cumulative returns
    data['cumulative_returns'] = (1 + data['strategy']).cumprod()

    return data

# Example data
data = pd.DataFrame({'price': [100, 102, 101, 105, 107]})
strategy_signals = np.array([1, -1, 0, 1, -1]) # Simplified example
backtest_results = backtest_strategy(data, strategy_signals)
print(backtest_results)
```

**Optimization Stage**: After achieving promising results in backtesting, the strategy moves to the optimization phase. Here, parameters within the algorithm are fine-tuned to maximize performance, typically using techniques like grid search or genetic algorithms.

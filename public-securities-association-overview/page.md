## Understanding the Public Securities Association (PSA)

The Public Securities Association (PSA) originated in 1976 as a pivotal trade organization representing traders who transacted in U.S. government securities. Established during a time of significant growth and innovation in the finance sector, the PSA was crucial in facilitating communication, establishing standards, and offering a collective voice for its members. Over the years, the organization rapidly expanded its influence, encompassing a wide array of activities and members within the financial market, including securities firms and banks. This strategic expansion was especially notable in the domain of municipal bond underwriting and trading, where the PSA played a key role in shaping market practices and policies.

In 1997, the PSA rebranded itself as the Bond Market Association. This transformation signified more than just a name change; it reflected a broadened scope of activities and a diversification of its membership base. By focusing not just on government securities but also on a more comprehensive array of financial instruments, the Bond Market Association positioned itself to better address the evolving needs and interests of its constituents. This broadened remit enabled the organization to adapt to the changing landscape of global finance, which increasingly demanded more inclusive and versatile market participation frameworks.

Recognizing the need for a unified representation within the wider financial sector, the PSA, by then the Bond Market Association, underwent a significant merger. In 2006, it combined forces with the Securities Industry Association to form the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). This merger was strategic, aiming to consolidate resources and influence, thus enhancing the ability of the newly formed entity to advocate for its members in a rapidly evolving financial environment. SIFMA now represents a vast network of professionals across the finance industry, promoting the interests of its members through advocacy, education, and research initiatives. Through this comprehensive representation, SIFMA continues the legacy of the PSA, championing a robust and dynamic financial market.

## The PSA Standard Prepayment Model

The PSA Standard Prepayment Model, developed by the Public Securities Association, remains a cornerstone in managing prepayment risk, particularly within mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The model was introduced to provide a standardized approach for forecasting prepayments, allowing investors to better gauge the risks and returns associated with MBS.

Fundamentally, the PSA model assumes a prepayment rate that increases over the initial years of a mortgage and then stabilizes. The assumptions are set as a monthly prepayment rate, expressed as a percentage, during the lifetime of the mortgage. The base model, referred to as 100% PSA, posits that prepayment rates increase by 0.2% for the first 30 months and stabilize at 6% annually thereafter. To reflect deviations from this "standard" scenario, practitioners use different PSA speeds; for instance, a 200% PSA scenario would assume prepayments occur at twice the rate of the base model.

This standardized methodology allows traders and analysts to better assess how prepayment rates influence the yield and risk of MBS over the life of the security. The PSA model accounts for age-related trends, acknowledging that prepayment rates generally rise as loans mature and homeowners refinance or relocate due to changes in interest rates or personal circumstances.

The adaptability of the PSA model is particularly valuable in a dynamic market environment. By providing a structured framework for understanding variable prepayment speeds, traders can make more informed decisions to optimize returns. The model enables scenarios testing through different PSA speeds, offering a flexible analysis to accommodate shifts in economic conditions that influence borrower behavior.

In essence, the PSA Standard Prepayment Model remains a critical tool for evaluating MBS, providing essential insights into potential cash flow variations and enabling the optimization of portfolios through a deeper understanding of prepayment risk dynamics.

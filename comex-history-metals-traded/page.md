```python
import pandas as pd

# Load historical price data
data = pd.read_csv('comex_data.csv')

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Generate signals
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA50'][50:] > data['SMA200'][50:], 1, 0)

# Calculate returns
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()
data['Returns'] = data['Close'].pct_change() * data['Position'].shift()

# Evaluate strategy
total_return = data['Returns'].sum()
print(f'Total Strategy Return: {total_return:.2f}')
```

Setting up a secure and low-latency trading environment is essential for executing trades efficiently. A low-latency setup ensures that trades are executed quickly, minimizing slippage. This may involve co-location with exchange servers and high-speed internet connections, which can significantly reduce the time between decision-making and trade execution.

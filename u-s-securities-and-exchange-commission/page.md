## What is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)?

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a government agency that helps protect people who invest money in the stock market. It makes sure that companies tell the truth about their businesses and how they are doing financially. This way, people can make smart choices about where to put their money.

The SEC also makes rules that companies have to follow when they want to sell stocks or bonds to the public. These rules help keep the stock market fair and safe for everyone. If a company or person breaks these rules, the SEC can take action to stop them and make things right.

## When was the SEC established and why?

The SEC was established in 1934. This happened during a time when many people were losing their money because of the stock market crash in 1929. The government wanted to make sure this wouldn't happen again, so they created the SEC to watch over the stock market and protect investors.

The main reason for creating the SEC was to bring more trust and fairness to the stock market. Before the SEC, there were no strict rules, and some people were cheating others by giving false information about their companies. The SEC was set up to stop this from happening and to make sure everyone had the same chance to make good investment choices.

## What are the main functions of the SEC?

The SEC has several important jobs. One of its main functions is to make sure that companies tell the truth about their financial health.

## What types of securities does the SEC regulate?

They promise to pay you back with interest over time.

There's also a division that helps people learn about investing, and one that looks after the SEC's money and how it runs.

The SEC is led by a group of five people called commissioners. The President of the United States picks these commissioners, and the Senate has to say it's okay.

The commissioners make important decisions about the rules the SEC makes and how it protects investors.

## Can you explain the SEC's enforcement process?

The SEC's enforcement process starts when they find out about a possible problem or someone tells them about it. They look into it to see if someone broke the rules. If they think someone did something wrong, they do a deeper investigation. They gather evidence and talk to people who might know what happened. If they find strong proof that rules were broken, they can decide to take action.

Once the SEC decides to take action, they can do different things. They might try to settle the case by making a deal with the person or company. This could mean the person pays a fine or agrees not to do it again. If they can't settle, the SEC might take the case to court.

## How does the SEC handle insider trading and other securities fraud?

The SEC works hard to stop insider trading and other types of securities fraud. Insider trading happens when someone uses secret information about a company to make money in the stock market.

If they find someone using secret information, they start an investigation. They gather evidence and talk to people who might know what happened. If they find strong proof, they can take action to stop the person and make things right.

Recently, the SEC took action against a company called Theranos and its founder, Elizabeth Holmes. Theranos said they had a new way to test blood that was better and cheaper than other methods. But it turned out they were lying about their technology. The SEC found out and charged them with fraud. Elizabeth Holmes had to pay a big fine and can't be a leader in a public company for a long time. This case showed how the SEC works to stop companies from lying to people who want to invest their money.

Another big case was against a company called Ripple Labs. The SEC said that Ripple was selling a type of digital money called XRP, which they thought was like selling stocks without following the rules. Ripple said XRP was not a stock and didn't need to follow those rules. This case is still going on, but it's important because it's about how the SEC is trying to make sure new types of money, like digital currencies, follow the same rules as other investments. By taking action in cases like these, the SEC helps keep the stock market fair and safe for everyone.

import numpy as np
from sklearn.covariance import LedoitWolf

# Load historical price data for assets
prices = pd.read_csv('historical_prices.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)

# Calculate log returns
returns = np.log(prices / prices.shift(1)).dropna()

# Compute mean returns and covariance matrix using the Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage method
mean_returns = returns.mean()
cov_matrix = LedoitWolf().fit(returns).covariance_

def portfolio_return(weights):
    return np.dot(weights, mean_returns)

def portfolio_volatility(weights):
    return np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(cov_matrix, weights)))

# Example: Define a risk tolerance level and solve for the optimal portfolio
risk_tolerance = 0.05
num_assets = len(mean_returns)
weights = np.ones(num_assets) / num_assets  # Initial equal allocation

# Optimizing using a simple grid search approach
best_return = 0
best_weights = None
for w in np.linspace(0, 1, 100):
    for i in range(num_assets):
        weights[i] = w
        ret = portfolio_return(weights)
        vol = portfolio_volatility(weights)
        if vol <= risk_tolerance and ret > best_return:
            best_return = ret
            best_weights = weights.copy()

print(f"Optimal Weights: {best_weights}")
print(f"Expected Portfolio Return: {best_return:.2%}")
```

LSTMs can remember patterns of order dependencies across time in datasets, which are crucial in financial markets.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Generating synthetic stock price data
timesteps = 100
features = 1
data = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 100, timesteps))

# Prepare data for LSTM
X = data[:-1].reshape((1, timesteps-1, features))
y = data[1:].reshape((1, timesteps-1))

# Define LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(timesteps-1, features)))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Fit model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=200, verbose=0)

# Predict using the model
prediction = model.predict(X, verbose=0)
plt.plot(data, label='True Data')
plt.plot(np.append([None], prediction.flatten()), label='Prediction')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This Python code snippet demonstrates a basic application of LSTM for stock price prediction, leveraging Keras for modeling. While synthetic data is used here, similar models can be trained on historical financial data for actual market prediction tasks.

## What is NYSE Arca?

NYSE Arca is a part of the New York Stock Exchange, which is a big place where people buy and sell stocks. NYSE Arca started as the ArcaEx, which was all about trading stocks electronically. This means that instead of people shouting and using hand signals to trade, they use computers. In 2006, the New York Stock Exchange bought ArcaEx and renamed it NYSE Arca.

NYSE Arca is special because it lets people trade things like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and options, not just regular stocks. ETFs are like baskets of different investments that you can buy and sell like a single stock. NYSE Arca is known for being one of the biggest places in the world for trading ETFs. It helps make trading easier and faster for everyone involved.

## How does NYSE Arca differ from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)?

NYSE Arca and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are both parts of the same big organization, but they do different things. The NYSE is the main place where people have been trading stocks for a long time. It's famous for its big trading floor where people used to shout and use hand signals to buy and sell stocks. Nowadays, the NYSE also uses computers a lot, but it still has that traditional feel.

On the other hand, NYSE Arca started as a place focused on trading stocks electronically, without the big trading floor. It's known for being a leader in trading exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and options. ETFs are like baskets of investments that you can buy and sell like a single stock.

## What are brainteasers and how do they relate to algorithmic trading?

Brainteasers are puzzles or problems that challenge your thinking and problem-solving skills. They often require you to think creatively and outside the box to find a solution. These puzzles can be fun and engaging, helping to improve your mental agility and logical reasoning.

In the world of algorithmic trading, brainteasers can be useful for training and honing the skills needed to develop effective trading algorithms. Algorithmic trading involves using computer programs to make trading decisions based on data analysis and mathematical models. By practicing with brainteasers, traders can improve their ability to think critically and solve complex problems, which is essential for creating and optimizing trading strategies.

## Why are brainteasers useful for someone starting in algo trading?

Brainteasers are helpful for people starting in algo trading because they make your brain better at solving problems. Algo trading needs you to think in smart ways to make computer programs that trade well. By doing brainteasers, you practice thinking about problems from different angles, which is important when you're trying to figure out the best way to trade.

Also, [brainteasers](/wiki/brainteasers) can make you better at understanding patterns and numbers, which are big parts of algo trading. When you work on these puzzles, you get used to looking for patterns and making quick decisions. This is a lot like what you need to do when you're creating trading algorithms, where you have to spot trends in the market and decide what to do fast. So, brainteasers can be a fun way to get ready for the challenges of algo trading.

## Can you explain a simple brainteaser that can help understand basic trading concepts?

Imagine you have $100 and you want to buy apples and oranges. Apples cost $2 each and oranges cost $3 each. Your goal is to spend all your money and end up with the same number of apples and oranges. How can you do it?

This brainteaser helps you think about balancing different things, just like in trading where you need to balance buying and selling different stocks or assets. In the puzzle, you need to figure out how to spend exactly $100 to get the same number of apples and oranges. You might try different combinations until you find that buying 25 apples and 15 oranges works because 25 x $2 + 15 x $3 = $100. In trading, you also need to find the right mix of assets to make the most profit, and this puzzle helps you practice that kind of thinking.

## How can brainteasers improve problem-solving skills in algorithmic trading?

Brainteasers help you get better at solving problems in [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) by making you practice thinking in different ways.

This is a lot like what you need to do in algo trading, where you have to figure out the best way to buy and sell things based on the information you have.

Also, brainteasers can make you better at seeing patterns and making quick decisions. In algo trading, you need to spot trends in the market and decide what to do fast. By doing brainteasers, you get used to thinking quickly and finding patterns, which helps you make better trading algorithms. So, brainteasers are a fun way to train your brain for the challenges of algo trading.

## What are some common types of brainteasers used in algo trading interviews?

In algo trading interviews, people often use brainteasers to see how well you can solve problems and think quickly. A common type of brainteaser is the logic puzzle, where you have to figure out a situation using clues. For example, you might be asked to solve a problem about how many handshakes happen at a party if everyone shakes hands with everyone else once. This helps interviewers see if you can break down a problem into smaller parts and solve it step by step, which is important in algo trading.

Another type of brainteaser used is the math puzzle, where you need to use numbers and equations to find an answer. For instance, you might be asked to find the next number in a sequence or solve a problem about how to split money fairly among a group of people. These puzzles test your ability to work with numbers and understand patterns, skills that are crucial for creating trading algorithms. By practicing these brainteasers, you can show interviewers that you have the skills needed to succeed in algo trading.

## How can practicing brainteasers help in developing trading algorithms?

## What is an intermediate level brainteaser that challenges understanding of market dynamics?

Imagine you're a farmer who grows wheat and corn. You can sell your wheat for $5 per bushel and your corn for $3 per bushel. The price of wheat goes up and down a lot, but the price of corn stays pretty steady. You have 100 bushels of wheat and 100 bushels of corn. You want to make as much money as you can over the next month. How should you sell your wheat and corn to make the most money?

This brainteaser challenges you to think about market dynamics, just like in trading where prices can change a lot. You need to decide if you should sell all your wheat right away when the price is high, or if you should wait and hope the price goes up even more. But if you wait too long, the price might go down. With corn, since the price doesn't change much, you might decide to sell it all at once or spread it out over the month. This puzzle helps you practice thinking about when to buy and sell, which is key in understanding how markets work and making good trading decisions.

## How do brainteasers help in optimizing trading strategies?

Brainteasers help you get better at thinking about problems in different ways, which is important for making trading strategies work better. When you do brainteasers, you practice solving puzzles by trying out different ideas until you find the best answer. This is a lot like what you need to do when you're trying to make your trading strategy better. You have to look at all the different ways you can buy and sell things and figure out which way makes the most money. By practicing brainteasers, you learn to think about problems from all sides, which helps you come up with smarter ways to trade.

Also, brainteasers can make you better at spotting patterns and making quick choices. In trading, you need to see what's happening in the market and decide what to do fast. By doing brainteasers, you get used to looking for patterns and making decisions quickly. This helps you make your trading strategies better because you can spot trends and act on them faster. So, brainteasers are a fun way to train your brain to be better at the kind of thinking you need to optimize your trading strategies.

## Can you provide an example of an advanced brainteaser that tests knowledge of statistical arbitrage?

Imagine you're a trader who uses statistical [arbitrage](/wiki/arbitrage) to make money. You have two stocks, Stock A and Stock B, that usually move together. You notice that over the last month, Stock A has been going up a lot more than Stock B. You think this difference will go away soon, so you want to use this to make money. You have $10,000 to invest. How can you use [statistical arbitrage](/wiki/statistical-arbitrage) to make the most money if you believe the prices will go back to moving together in the next week?

In statistical arbitrage, you would buy the stock that's gone down more (Stock B) and sell short the stock that's gone up more (Stock A). If you're right and the prices go back to moving together, you can buy back Stock A at a lower price and sell Stock B at a higher price, making a profit. For example, if you use all your $10,000 to buy 1,000 shares of Stock B at $10 each and short sell 500 shares of Stock A at $20 each, you'll make money if Stock B goes up to $11 and Stock A goes down to $19. This brainteaser helps you practice thinking about how to use the idea of prices moving back together to make trading decisions.

## How can brainteasers be used to assess risk management in algorithmic trading?

Brainteasers can help assess how well someone can manage risk in algorithmic trading by making them think about different ways to solve problems. In algo trading, you need to make choices about when to buy and sell things, and you have to think about what could go wrong. Brainteasers can be set up to test this by giving you a puzzle where you have to decide how to spend money or make trades with the chance that things might not go as planned. By seeing how someone solves these puzzles, you can tell if they think about risk and try to keep it low, which is important in trading.

For example, a brainteaser might ask you to split money between different investments, each with different risks and rewards. You have to figure out the best way to do this to make the most money while keeping the risk low. This is a lot like what you need to do in algo trading, where you have to balance making money with keeping your investments safe. By practicing with these brainteasers, you can get better at thinking about risk and making smart choices, which helps you manage risk better in real trading situations.

## What role do brainteasers play in understanding high-frequency trading concepts?

Brainteasers help you understand high-frequency trading by making you practice thinking fast and solving problems quickly. In high-frequency trading, you need to make a lot of trades very fast, often in milliseconds. Brainteasers can be set up to make you think about how to make quick decisions, just like you need to do in high-frequency trading. For example, a brainteaser might ask you to find the best way to buy and sell things in a short time, which helps you practice the kind of fast thinking you need for high-frequency trading.

Also, brainteasers can help you get better at understanding patterns and making choices based on small changes. In high-frequency trading, you need to spot tiny changes in the market and act on them right away. By doing brainteasers that make you look for patterns and make quick decisions, you can get better at the skills you need for high-frequency trading. So, brainteasers are a fun way to train your brain for the fast-paced world of high-frequency trading.

## How can one create their own brainteasers to further enhance their algorithmic trading skills?

To create your own brainteasers for improving your algorithmic trading skills, you can start by thinking about the kinds of problems you face in trading. For example, you might make a puzzle where you have to decide how to buy and sell stocks with different prices that change over time. You can set up rules like having a certain amount of money to spend and trying to make the most profit. This helps you practice thinking about how to make the best choices in trading.

Another way to make brainteasers is to use real trading data to create puzzles. You could take a set of stock prices from the past and make a game where you have to predict what will happen next. This can help you get better at spotting patterns and making quick decisions, which are important in algorithmic trading. By making your own brainteasers, you can focus on the skills you need to work on and have fun while learning.


## Market Making and Betting

- Flip 98 fair coins and 1 HH coin and 1 TT coin. Given that you see an H, what is the probability that it was the HH coin? Explain in layman’s terms.
- Flip 10000 fair coins. You are offered a 1-1 bet that the sum is less than 5000. You can bet 1, 2, ..., 100 dollars. How much will you bet. How much will you bet if someone tells you that the sum of the coins is less than 5100?
- Roll a die repeatedly. Say that you stop when the sum goes above 63. What is the probability that the second to last value was X. Make a market on this probability. Ie what is your 90 percent confidence interval.
- There are closed envelopes with $2, $4, $8, $16, $32, and $64 lined up in sorted order in front of you. Two envelopes next to each other are picked up and shuffled. One is given to you and one is given to your friend. You and you friend then open your own envelopes, look inside, and then decide whether or not to offer to trade. If you both agree to trade, then you will swap. Assume you open your envelope and see $16. Should you offer to trade?
- Generate N random values from a random variable where the value N comes from some other variable. Make a market on the sum of the values.
- Find the log-utility optimal fraction of your capital to bet on a fair coinflip where you win x on a heads and lose y on tails.
- This question is very hard to explain. It is intended to judge how much of a feel you have for risk in an adversarial setting with various bits of information about how much your counterparty might be trying to screw you and how much control they have over the game. It goes something like this: The interviewer, who has the mannerisms of an amateur magician, holds up a top hat. He puts five yellow nerf balls in it. Pulls one ball from the hat. It is a yellow nerf ball. Would you bet on the next four balls being yellow? What if I made you pay to play? What if I was your friend? What if your friend put the balls in? What if I made you pay more? etc etc...
- Explain how you would handle a trading model with 25 factors differently than one with 100. What you would ask or do next if the 100 factor model had 25% better performance than the 25 factor model?
- If a stock starts at a price of p and then goes up x% then down x%, is its price greater than, less than, or equal to p?
- You have 100 dollars. You are playing a game where you wager x dollars on a biased coin flip with a 90 percent probability of heads. You make 2x if it’s heads and lose the x dollars if it’s tails. How much do you think you should bet on each flip if you are going to play for 100 flips?
- Make a market on a derivative with a price equal to the number of pothole covers in New York.

## Probability

- What is the pobability of getting exactly 500 heads out of 1000 coin flips? Approximate it to within 5% of the true value without a calculator.
- Play a game like chess or pingpong. You only have two opponents, A and B. A is better than B. You will play three games. There are only two orders you can play: ABA and BAB. Which gives you a better chance of winning?
- Play a 1 vs 1 game. I roll a 6 sided die, if I get a 1 I win, if not you roll. If you get a 6 you win, otherwise I go again... What are my chances of winning and what are yours?
- Normal 52 card deck. Cards are dealt one-by-one. You get to say when to stop. After you say stop you win a dollar if the next card is red, lose a dollar if the next is black. Assuming you use the optimal stopping strategy, how much would you be willing to pay to play? Proof?
- Assume there is a diagnostic drug for detecting a certain cancer. It is 99% sensitive and 99% specific. 0.5% of the population has this cancer. What is the probability that a randomly selected person from the population has this cancer given that you diagnose them using the drug and it comes back positive?
- You have 3 pancakes in a stack. 1 is burned on both sides, 1 burned on 1 side, 1 burned on no sides. What is P(burned on other side — burned on the top)?
- Roll a die until the first 6. What’s the expected number of rolls? What’s the expected number of rolls until two sixes in a row? How about a six then a five? Are they different?
- Say you roll a die, and are given an amount in dollar equal to the number on the die. What would you pay to play this game if you played it a many times in a row? Now say that when you roll the die, you’re allowed to either take the money that you’d get with the roll, or roll a second time; if you roll a second time, you’re obligated to take the number of dollars that you get with the second roll. Now what is the worth of the game? Same thing as above, except you have an option to play the game a third time.
- Let’s say you’re playing a two-player game where you take turns flipping a coin and whoever flips heads first wins. If the winner gets 1 dollar, how much would you pay to go first instead of second?
- Two fair coins are flipped behind a curtain. You are told at least one came up heads. Given that information and nothing else, what is the probability that both landed heads?
- You are trying to determine the price a casino should charge to play a dice game. The player rolls a die and gets paid the amount on the face, however he can choose to re-roll the dice, giving up the chance to take the first payout amount before seeing the second result. Similarly he has the same option on the second roll, but after the second re-roll, he must keep the amount shown the third time. How much should the casino charge to break even in expectation on this game assuming the player chooses the best strategy?
- You have 5 quarters on the table in front of you: four fair (regular two-sided coins) and one double-sided (both sides are heads). You pick one of them up at random, flip it five times, and get heads each time. Given this information, what is the probability that you picked up the double-sided quarter?

## Retention of Coursework

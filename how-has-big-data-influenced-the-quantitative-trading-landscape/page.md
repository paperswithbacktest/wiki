The explosion of "big data" has had a significant impact on the quantitative trading landscape. Here's how big data has influenced the field:

1. **Access to New Data Sources**: Big data has introduced a variety of new sources of information, such as social network data, geolocation data, satellite information, and many others. This data can be used to generate new trading signals or improve existing strategies.
2. **Increased Strategy Complexity**: With access to massive volumes of data, quantitative traders can develop and test more complex strategies, which take into account a greater number of factors.
3. **Improved Forecasting**: Analysis of large data sets can help identify patterns or trends that were not perceptible with smaller data sets. This can potentially improve forecast accuracy.
4. **Accrus Technology Needs**: Big data management and analysis require robust technology infrastructures. This has led to increased investment in data storage, processing and analysis technologies.
5. **Data Quality Challenges**: With the increasing volume of data available, ensuring the quality, relevance and accuracy of this data has become a major challenge. Managing missing, erroneous or duplicate data is crucial.
6. **Overfitting risks**: With access to so much data, there is an increased risk of developing over-specific models that work well on historical data, but fail under real-life conditions.
7. **Ethics and Confidentiality**: The collection and use of Big Data raises questions of ethics and confidentiality. Companies need to ensure that they comply with regulations and ethical standards when using data, especially when it comes to personal data.
8. **Increased competition**: As more and more players recognize the value of big data in quantitative trading, competition to exploit this data and develop innovative strategies is intensifying.

In conclusion, big data has profoundly transformed quantitative trading, offering new opportunities but also introducing new challenges. The ability to navigate this complex and constantly evolving environment will determine the success of players in this field.

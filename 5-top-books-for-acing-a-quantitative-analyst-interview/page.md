Algorithm design is fundamental to creating robust trading systems. The 'Green Book' advises an iterative approach to design, where traders start with a basic framework and gradually refine it. This process often involves [backtesting](/wiki/backtesting) against historical data to identify strengths and weaknesses. A common practice, as outlined, is to begin with a simple moving average crossover strategy. Traders can expand its complexity with additional indicators or conditions. For example, a basic strategy in Python might look like this:

```python
import pandas as pd

def moving_average_strategy(data, short_window=40, long_window=100):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Create short simple moving average over the short_window
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Create long simple moving average over the long_window
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Generate signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   

    # Generate trading orders
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals
```

Optimization plays a significant role in enhancing algorithms. It involves finding the optimal set of parameters that maximize profitability while minimizing risk. Techniques such as genetic algorithms or machine learning models have been discussed in the 'Green Book' as powerful tools for optimization. Risk management, a critical part of algorithmic trading, ensures algorithms operate within acceptable loss parameters.

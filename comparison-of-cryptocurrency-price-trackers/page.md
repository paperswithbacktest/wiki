```python
import ccxt
import pandas as pd

# Initialize exchange
exchange = ccxt.binance()
symbol = 'BTC/USDT'

# Fetch historical data
ohlcv = exchange.fetch_ohlcv(symbol, timeframe='1h')
data = pd.DataFrame(ohlcv, columns=['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'])

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA50'] = data['close'].rolling(50).mean()
data['MA200'] = data['close'].rolling(200).mean()

# Signal for crossover
data['Signal'] = data['MA50'] > data['MA200']

# Execute order if condition is met
if data['Signal'].iloc[-1]:
    order = exchange.create_market_buy_order(symbol, 1)  # Buy 1 BTC
```

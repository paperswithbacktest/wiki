data['SMA200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Generate signals
data['Signal'] = 0.0
data['Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA50'][50:] > data['SMA200'][50:], 1.0, 0.0)
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Plot results
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price')
plt.plot(data['SMA50'], label='50 Day MA')
plt.plot(data['SMA200'], label='200 Day MA')
plt.plot(data[data['Position'] == 1].index, data['SMA50'][data['Position'] == 1], '^', lw=3, label='Buy Signal', color='g')
plt.plot(data[data['Position'] == -1].index, data['SMA50'][data['Position'] == -1], 'v', lw=3, label='Sell Signal', color='r')

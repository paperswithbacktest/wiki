## What are asset-backed securities (ABS)?

Asset-backed securities (ABS) are financial products that are created when a company pools together various types of loans or receivables and sells them to investors. These loans or receivables can include things like auto loans, credit card debt, or mortgages. By bundling these assets together, the company can then issue securities that are backed by the cash flows from these underlying assets. This means that investors who buy these securities are essentially buying a piece of the payments that borrowers make on their loans.

ABS can be attractive to investors because they offer a way to invest in a diversified pool of assets, which can help spread out risk. For example, if one borrower defaults on their loan, the impact on the overall security is minimized because it's just one part of a larger pool. Additionally, ABS can provide a steady stream of income, as the payments from the underlying loans are passed on to the investors. However, like any investment, ABS come with risks, such as the possibility that more borrowers than expected might default on their loans, which could affect the value and performance of the securities.

## How do asset-backed securities work?

Asset-backed securities work by taking a bunch of loans, like car loans or credit card debts, and putting them all together into one big group. A company then sells this group of loans to investors. When people who took out these loans make their payments, that money goes to the investors who bought the securities. It's like the investors own a piece of all those loans and get paid from the money coming in.

The idea is to spread out the risk. If one person can't pay back their loan, it's not a big deal because there are lots of other loans in the group. This makes the investment safer for the people buying the securities. But, there's still a chance that more people than expected might not pay back their loans, which could cause problems for the investors. So, while asset-backed securities can be a good way to get regular payments, they also come with some risks.

## What types of assets can be used to back securities?

Asset-backed securities can be backed by all sorts of loans and debts. Common ones include car loans, where people borrow money to buy cars and then pay it back over time. Credit card debts are another popular choice, where people use their cards and pay back what they owe. There are also home loans, known as mortgages, where people borrow money to buy houses and pay it back monthly.

Student loans can also be used to back securities. These are loans that students take out to pay for college and then repay after they finish their studies. Another type is lease payments, where businesses or people rent equipment or property and make regular payments. Even things like royalties from music or movies can be bundled together and turned into securities.

All these different types of loans and payments can be grouped together to create asset-backed securities. This helps spread out the risk because if one person can't pay back their loan, there are still many others who might. But if a lot of people can't pay back their loans, it can cause problems for the investors who bought the securities.

## What are the main types of asset-backed securities?

Asset-backed securities come in different types, depending on what kind of loans they are made from. One common type is mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are made from home loans. When people buy houses and pay back their mortgages, that money goes to the investors who own these securities. Another type is auto loan-backed securities, where the loans are for buying cars. As people pay back their car loans, that money goes to the investors.

There are also credit card-backed securities, which are made from credit card debts. When people use their credit cards and pay back what they owe, the money goes to the investors. Student loan-backed securities are another type, where the loans help students pay for college. As students pay back their loans, the money goes to the investors. Each type of asset-backed security works a bit differently, but they all involve pooling together many loans and selling them to investors who then get paid from the loan payments.

## How do mortgage-backed securities (MBS) differ from other ABS?

Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are a special type of asset-backed security that is made from home loans. When people buy houses and take out mortgages, those loans can be bundled together and sold to investors. The key difference between MBS and other asset-backed securities is that MBS are specifically backed by mortgages, while other ABS can be backed by different types of loans, like car loans or credit card debts. This means that the money investors get from MBS comes from people paying back their home loans.

Another difference is how MBS are structured. MBS often come in two forms: pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Pass-through securities work by passing the payments from the underlying mortgages directly to the investors. CMOs, on the other hand, are more complex and divide the payments into different levels of risk and return, called tranches. This structure is unique to MBS and helps investors choose the level of risk they are comfortable with. Other types of ABS, like those backed by auto loans or student loans, usually don't have this kind of detailed structure.

## What are the benefits of investing in asset-backed securities?

One big benefit of investing in asset-backed securities is that they can give you a steady stream of money. When people pay back their loans, like car loans or credit card debts, that money comes to you as an investor. This can be really helpful if you want regular payments without having to worry too much about the ups and downs of the stock market. Also, asset-backed securities are usually made from a big group of loans, which helps spread out the risk. If one person can't pay back their loan, it's not a big problem because there are lots of other loans in the group.

Another benefit is that asset-backed securities can be a good way to diversify your investments. Instead of putting all your money into one type of investment, like stocks, you can invest in different kinds of loans. This can help protect your money if something goes wrong in one area of the market. Plus, asset-backed securities can sometimes offer higher returns than other types of investments, like bonds. But remember, there's always some risk involved, so it's important to understand what you're investing in.

## What are the risks associated with asset-backed securities?

One risk of investing in asset-backed securities is that people might not pay back their loans. If a lot of people can't pay back their car loans, credit card debts, or mortgages, it can cause problems for the investors. This is called default risk. When many people default on their loans, the value of the securities can go down, and investors might not get the money they were expecting. Another risk is [interest rate](/wiki/interest-rate-trading-strategies) risk. If interest rates go up, the value of the securities can go down because new loans will be more attractive to investors.

Another risk is called prepayment risk. This happens when people pay back their loans earlier than expected, like when someone pays off their mortgage early. When this happens, investors might get their money back sooner than they planned, and they might have to find new places to invest it. This can be a problem if they can't find investments that offer the same level of return. Also, asset-backed securities can be hard to sell quickly if you need your money back fast. This is called [liquidity](/wiki/liquidity-risk-premium) risk. If there aren't many buyers for the securities, you might have to sell them for less than you paid, which can be a problem.

## How are asset-backed securities structured?

Asset-backed securities are made by taking a bunch of loans, like car loans or credit card debts, and putting them all together into one big group. A company then sells this group of loans to investors. The money that comes in from people paying back their loans is used to pay the investors. This means the investors own a piece of all those loans and get money from the payments that come in. The idea is to spread out the risk. If one person can't pay back their loan, it's not a big deal because there are lots of other loans in the group.

Sometimes, asset-backed securities are split into different levels of risk and return, called tranches. This means some investors might get paid first and have less risk, while others might get paid later but could earn more if everything goes well. This structure can be more complicated but gives investors different choices based on how much risk they want to take. The way asset-backed securities are set up can be different depending on what kind of loans they are made from, but they all work by pooling together many loans and selling them to investors who then get paid from the loan payments.

## What role do special purpose vehicles (SPVs) play in ABS?

Special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, are important for making asset-backed securities. An SPV is a special company that is set up just to buy the loans, like car loans or credit card debts, from the company that made them. The SPV then puts these loans together into a group and sells them to investors as asset-backed securities. This helps keep the loans separate from the company that made them, which can be safer for investors because if the company has problems, it won't affect the loans in the SPV.

Using an SPV also helps make sure that the money from the loans goes straight to the investors. The SPV collects the payments from the people who took out the loans and then passes that money on to the investors who bought the securities. This way, the investors can feel more secure because the SPV is only focused on managing the loans and making sure the money gets where it needs to go.

## How is the credit quality of asset-backed securities assessed?

The credit quality of asset-backed securities is assessed by looking at how likely the people who took out the loans are to pay them back. This is called the creditworthiness of the borrowers. To figure this out, people look at things like the borrowers' credit scores, how much money they make, and their history of paying back loans. They also think about how the economy is doing, because if a lot of people lose their jobs, it might be harder for them to pay back their loans. All these factors help decide how safe the asset-backed securities are and what kind of interest rate they should have.

Another way to assess the credit quality is by looking at how the asset-backed securities are set up. Some securities are divided into different levels of risk, called tranches. The top tranches are paid first and are seen as safer, so they have a higher credit quality. The bottom tranches are paid last and are riskier, so they have a lower credit quality. Rating agencies, like Moody's or Standard & Poor's, also play a big role. They give the securities a grade, like AAA or BB, based on how likely they are to pay back the investors. A higher grade means the securities are seen as safer and have a better credit quality.

## What regulatory considerations should be noted for asset-backed securities?

When dealing with asset-backed securities, there are important rules and regulations to keep in mind. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is in charge of making sure these securities follow the rules. They have special rules for asset-backed securities, like making sure companies tell investors all the important information about the loans that back the securities. This is so investors can make smart choices about whether to buy them. There are also rules about how the securities are sold and how the money from the loans is handled.

Another big part of the regulations comes from the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed after the 2008 financial crisis. This law made new rules to try and prevent problems with asset-backed securities from happening again. It includes things like requiring companies to keep some of the risk of the loans they sell, called risk retention. This means they have to keep some of the loans on their [books](/wiki/algo-trading-books), so they have a reason to make sure the loans are good quality. There are also rules about how clear and honest companies have to be when they tell investors about the securities. All these rules help make sure asset-backed securities are safer for everyone involved.

## How have asset-backed securities evolved since the 2008 financial crisis?

Since the 2008 financial crisis, asset-backed securities have changed a lot. Before the crisis, many of these securities were made from risky home loans, called subprime mortgages. These loans were often given to people who couldn't really afford them, and when they couldn't pay back their loans, it caused big problems. After the crisis, rules were made stricter to make sure this didn't happen again. Now, companies have to be more careful about the loans they use to make these securities. They also have to keep some of the risk themselves, which means they have to make sure the loans are good quality.

Another big change is that there's more information and openness about asset-backed securities now. Companies have to tell investors a lot more about the loans that back the securities, so investors can make better choices. Also, there are now different levels of risk in the securities, called tranches, which help investors pick how much risk they want to take. These changes have made asset-backed securities safer and more trusted than they were before the crisis.

Entering the field of quantitative trading or "quant trading" requires a combination of academic training, technical skills and practical experience.

- To begin with, **a solid academic background** is essential. Many quants have advanced degrees in mathematics, physics, engineering, finance or statistics. If you're already committed to a career or course of study, consider adding courses in quantitative finance, econometrics and financial modeling to your curriculum.
- **Technical skills** are also crucial. It would be wise to learn programming languages commonly used in the field, such as Python, R, C++ or Java. Familiarity with quantitative trading platforms such as QuantConnect or Quantopian, as well as software such as MATLAB, will also be beneficial.
- **Experience** is often the key. Actively seek internships or junior-level positions with hedge funds, investment banks or proprietary trading firms. At the same time, consider developing your own trading models and strategies and testing them on historical data.
- **Networking** can open many doors. Attending conferences and seminars on quantitative finance, joining professional associations, and building relationships with industry players can help. Even if the focus is on quantity, a basic understanding of financial markets and products remains indispensable.
- Always **keep up to date**. Finance is an ever-changing world, so keep up to date with the latest research and innovations. Interviews for quant positions can be technical, so prepare well. Finally, risk management is fundamental to trading, so make sure you understand it.

Keep in mind that perseverance, a passion for quantitative analysis and a continuous learning attitude will be your best assets in this competitive field.

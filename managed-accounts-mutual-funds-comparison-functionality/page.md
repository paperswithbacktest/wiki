## What is a managed account?

A managed account is a type of investment account where a professional money manager makes the investment decisions for you. Instead of picking your own stocks or funds, you let an expert handle it. This can be helpful if you don't have the time or knowledge to manage your investments yourself.

These accounts are often used by people who want to invest in the stock market but don't want to do all the work themselves. The money manager will create a portfolio based on your goals and risk tolerance. They will also monitor and adjust the investments as needed to try to achieve the best possible returns for you.

## What is a mutual fund?

A mutual fund is a type of investment where many people pool their money together to buy a variety of stocks, bonds, or other assets. It's like a big basket where everyone puts in some money, and a professional manager decides what to buy with it. This way, even if you don't have a lot of money, you can still own a small piece of many different investments.

Mutual funds are popular because they let you diversify your investments easily. Instead of buying just one or two stocks, you get a mix of many, which can help reduce risk. The manager of the fund does all the work of [picking](/wiki/asset-class-picking) and watching the investments, so you don't have to be an expert yourself. You just need to choose a fund that matches your goals and how much risk you're willing to take.

## How do managed accounts and mutual funds differ in terms of ownership?

In a managed account, you own the individual investments directly. This means if the account holds stocks or bonds, you are the actual owner of those specific assets. The money manager just makes the decisions about what to buy and sell, but the investments are in your name. This gives you more control over what's in your portfolio, and you can see exactly which stocks or bonds you own at any time.

In a mutual fund, you don't own the individual stocks or bonds directly. Instead, you own shares of the mutual fund itself. The fund owns a variety of investments, and your share represents a piece of that whole pool. This means you don't get to pick the specific investments; you just choose the fund, and the fund manager decides what to buy and sell within it. So, while you're still investing in the market, your ownership is in the fund, not in the individual assets it holds.

## What are the typical fees associated with managed accounts?

Managed accounts usually have two main types of fees: management fees and transaction fees. Management fees are what you pay the professional money manager for their time and expertise in handling your investments. These fees are often a percentage of the total assets in your account, usually around 1% to 2% per year. So, if you have $100,000 in your account, you might pay $1,000 to $2,000 a year in management fees.

Transaction fees are the costs for buying and selling investments within your account. Every time the manager makes a trade, there might be a fee, which can add up over time. These fees can vary a lot depending on the type of investments and how often the manager trades. Some managed accounts might also have other fees, like account maintenance fees or fees for special services, but management and transaction fees are the most common ones you'll see.

## What are the typical fees associated with mutual funds?

Mutual funds usually have two main types of fees: expense ratios and sales loads. The expense ratio is a yearly fee that covers the costs of running the fund, like paying the fund manager and other operational expenses. This fee is a percentage of your investment, often around 0.5% to 1.5% per year. So, if you invest $10,000 in a fund with a 1% expense ratio, you'll pay $100 a year in fees.

Sales loads are fees you might pay when you buy or sell shares of the fund. There are different types of sales loads. A front-end load is a fee you pay when you buy the shares, and it can be around 3% to 6% of your investment. A back-end load, or deferred sales charge, is a fee you pay when you sell your shares, and it can decrease the longer you hold the fund. Some funds don't have sales loads at all, and they're called no-load funds.

## How does the level of customization compare between managed accounts and mutual funds?

Managed accounts offer a high level of customization. This means you can work with the money manager to create an investment plan that fits your specific goals and needs. For example, if you want to invest in certain types of companies or avoid others, the manager can tailor the portfolio just for you. You can also set rules about how much risk you're okay with and how often you want the investments to change. This makes managed accounts very personal and flexible.

Mutual funds, on the other hand, have much less customization. When you invest in a mutual fund, you're buying into a pool of money that's managed according to the fund's set strategy. You can't tell the fund manager to change the investments to match your personal preferences. Instead, you pick a fund that's already set up in a way that matches your general investment goals, like growth or income. So, while mutual funds give you access to diversified investments, they don't let you customize the way a managed account does.

## What are the tax implications of investing in a managed account versus a mutual fund?

When you invest in a managed account, you have more control over the tax implications of your investments. Because you own the individual stocks or bonds directly, you can decide when to buy or sell them, which can help you manage your tax bill. For example, you might choose to sell certain investments at a loss to offset gains in other parts of your portfolio, a strategy known as tax-loss harvesting. Additionally, because the money manager can make decisions with your tax situation in mind, managed accounts can be more tax-efficient than mutual funds.

In a mutual fund, the tax implications can be less predictable and potentially more costly. When the fund manager buys or sells investments within the fund, it can trigger capital gains that are passed on to all the fund's shareholders, even if you didn't sell any of your shares. This means you could end up owing taxes on gains you didn't directly benefit from. Also, because you can't control the buying and selling within the fund, you can't use strategies like tax-loss harvesting. So, while mutual funds offer diversification and professional management, they might not be as tax-efficient as a managed account.

## How does the investment strategy of a managed account differ from that of a mutual fund?

In a managed account, the investment strategy is tailored to fit your specific goals and needs. The money manager works with you to understand what you want to achieve and how much risk you're willing to take. Based on that, they create a custom portfolio just for you. They might focus on certain types of investments, like stocks or bonds, or even specific sectors or companies. The manager can also adjust the strategy over time to keep it in line with your changing goals. This means your investments can be very personalized and can change as your life does.

In a mutual fund, the investment strategy is set by the fund and doesn't change based on your personal goals. When you invest in a mutual fund, you're buying into a pool of money that follows a specific strategy, like growth or income. The fund manager decides what to buy and sell within the fund, but they don't take your individual needs into account. This means you're investing in a strategy that's already decided, and it won't change just because your goals do. While this can still be a good way to invest, it's less personalized than a managed account.

## What are the minimum investment requirements for managed accounts and mutual funds?

Managed accounts often need a big amount of money to start. This is because they are made just for you and need a professional to manage them. You might need to put in at least $100,000 or even more to open one. Some places might let you start with less, like $25,000, but that's not common. The high minimum is because the manager needs enough money to make a good plan for you and to cover their fees.

Mutual funds usually need less money to start. You can often begin with as little as $1,000 or even less. Some funds let you start with just $100 or no minimum at all if you agree to set up regular investments. This makes mutual funds easier for more people to get into, even if they don't have a lot of money to start with.

## How do managed accounts and mutual funds handle risk management?

In a managed account, the money manager works with you to figure out how much risk you want to take. They then build a plan that fits your comfort level. If you don't like a lot of risk, they might put more of your money in safe investments like bonds. If you're okay with more risk, they might choose more stocks. The manager can also change the plan if things in the market change or if your goals change. This way, they can keep your investments safe and try to make them grow.

In a mutual fund, the risk management is set by the fund's strategy, not by what you want. The fund manager decides how much risk to take based on what the fund is trying to do. For example, a growth fund might take more risk to try to make more money, while an income fund might be safer but grow slower. You can't tell the fund manager to change the risk for you. So, when you pick a mutual fund, you're choosing a level of risk that's already decided, and it won't change just because your feelings about risk do.

## What role does a financial advisor play in managing a managed account compared to a mutual fund?

In a managed account, a financial advisor plays a big role. They work closely with you to understand your goals and how much risk you want to take. Then, they create a special plan just for you. They pick the investments and can change them if things in your life or the market change. This means they help make sure your money is doing what you want it to do, and they can help you save on taxes too.

In a mutual fund, a financial advisor's role is different. They help you pick the right fund based on what you want to achieve, but they don't control what's inside the fund. The fund has its own manager who decides what to buy and sell. So, the advisor's job is more about finding the best fund for you and maybe helping you understand it, but they can't change how the fund works or what it invests in.

## How do performance metrics and benchmarks differ between managed accounts and mutual funds?

In a managed account, performance metrics are all about how well your personal investments are doing. The money manager looks at things like how much your account has grown, how it's doing compared to the market, and how it's meeting your goals. They might use benchmarks like the S&P 500 to see if your account is doing better or worse than the overall market. Because the account is made just for you, the performance metrics are very personal and can be changed to fit what you want.

In a mutual fund, performance metrics are about how the whole fund is doing. The fund manager looks at things like the fund's total return, how it's doing compared to other similar funds, and how it's doing against its own goals. They use benchmarks like the S&P 500 or other indexes that match the fund's strategy. Because a mutual fund is shared by many people, the performance metrics are the same for everyone in the fund and can't be changed just for you.

## What are Betterment and E*TRADE Core Portfolios?

Betterment is an online investment platform that helps people manage their money easily. It's known for being a robo-advisor, which means it uses computer programs to create and manage investment portfolios for its users. Betterment asks you questions about your goals and how much risk you're willing to take, then it builds a personalized investment plan for you. It automatically adjusts your investments to keep them in line with your goals and risk level. Betterment also offers features like tax-loss harvesting, which can help you save money on taxes.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios is another robo-advisor service, but it's offered by E*TRADE, a well-known online brokerage. Like Betterment, E*TRADE Core Portfolios uses algorithms to build and manage your investment portfolio based on your goals and risk tolerance. It's designed to be simple and easy to use, making investing accessible to everyone. E*TRADE Core Portfolios also provides regular account updates and rebalances your portfolio to keep it aligned with your investment strategy. Both services aim to make investing easier and more efficient, but they come from different companies with slightly different features and fees.

## How do Betterment and E*TRADE Core Portfolios differ in terms of investment options?

Betterment offers a wide range of investment options that are designed to fit different goals and levels of risk. They have portfolios that include stocks, bonds, and other assets like real estate and commodities.

They even offer a cash management account for those who want to keep some of their money in a safe place while still earning a bit of interest.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios, on the other hand, focuses on a more straightforward approach. They mainly use exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to build your portfolio. These ETFs cover a mix of stocks and bonds, and E*TRADE tries to keep things simple by not offering as many specialized options as Betterment. If you're looking for a basic, easy-to-understand investment plan, E*TRADE Core Portfolios might be the better choice. But if you want more variety and the ability to customize your investments, Betterment could be more suitable for you.

## What are the fee structures for Betterment and E*TRADE Core Portfolios?

Betterment has two types of accounts: a basic one and a premium one. The basic account has a fee of 0.25% of the money you have invested each year.

Both accounts also have fees from the funds they invest in, which are usually around 0.07% to 0.15% a year.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios also rebalances your portfolio automatically, but they might do it a bit differently. They look at your investments from time to time and adjust them to keep everything in line with your plan. If your stocks or bonds get out of balance, E*TRADE will sell some and buy others to fix it.

## Which is better: Betterment or E*TRADE Core Portfolios?

Betterment and E*TRADE Core Portfolios are prominent players in the landscape of robo-advisory services, each offering distinct [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) features tailored to various investor profiles. 

### Algorithmic Trading Features

Betterment primarily focuses on leveraging sophisticated algorithms for personalized portfolio management. It offers automated rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting, which are designed to optimize investment strategies and enhance after-tax returns. Betterment's algorithms are built to maximize efficiency through a rules-based approach, ensuring portfolios remain aligned with the user's financial goals and risk tolerance.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios also employ algorithmic strategies, emphasizing portfolio optimization and risk management. One of its notable features is automatic rebalancing, similar to Betterment, which helps maintain the intended asset allocation as market conditions fluctuate. Additionally, E*TRADE integrates tax efficiency solutions, though its approach is less centered on advanced tax-loss harvesting compared to Betterment, focusing instead on broad tax efficiencies.

### Fees and Costs

Betterment charges an annual fee that typically ranges from 0.25% to 0.40% of assets under management (AUM). This fee structure is competitive, especially for investors seeking value from tax strategies and a sophisticated algorithmic framework. In contrast, E*TRADE's fee is around 0.30% of AUM, positioning it slightly above Betterment's basic tier but with potential savings for investors who do not require elaborate tax optimization strategies.

Fees are a critical consideration, as higher fees can erode investment gains over time. The formula for calculating the impact of fees is as follows:

$$
\text{Net Return} = \text{Gross Return} - \text{Fees}
$$

Where $\text{Fees}$ could range depending on AUM and the specific fee percentage.

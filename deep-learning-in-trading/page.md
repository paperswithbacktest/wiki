## Building and Training Deep Learning Models

To develop effective deep learning models for trading, selecting the appropriate architectures and algorithms is crucial. Deep learning in trading primarily employs either supervised learning or reinforcement learning techniques. 

In supervised learning, the model is trained using labeled data, where the input features are historical market data, and the output labels represent the target prediction, such as future price movements. The objective is to minimize the loss function $L(y, \hat{y})$, where $y$ is the true label and $\hat{y}$ is the predicted label. Common architectures used in this approach include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are adept at capturing complex temporal dependencies in time-series data.

Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, involves an agent making decisions within a market environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Here, the learning algorithm iteratively improves its decision-making policy $\pi$ based on the feedback received from the environment, which is typically represented by a reward signal. The model learns optimal strategies by exploring various trading actions and adjusting the policy through techniques like Q-learning or policy gradient methods.

The training process for these models often demands extensive computational resources. The high dimensionality of financial data necessitates the use of specialized hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), or cloud-based solutions, which offer the scalability required for processing large datasets efficiently.

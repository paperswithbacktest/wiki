## What is a quant and what do they do?

A quant, short for quantitative analyst, is a person who uses math and computer skills to help make decisions in finance. They work in banks, investment firms, and other financial places. Quants use numbers and data to predict how markets will move and to find good investments. They create models and use special computer programs to do this work.

Quants do many different jobs. Some quants focus on trading, where they use their models to buy and sell things like stocks and bonds. Others work on risk management, trying to figure out how much risk a company is taking and how to reduce it. No matter what they do, quants need to be good at math, coding, and understanding financial markets.

## What educational background is required to become a quant?

To become a quant, you usually need a strong background in math, statistics, and computer science. Most quants have at least a bachelor's degree in one of these fields. Some go on to get a master's degree or even a PhD, which can help them get better jobs and make more money. The important thing is to learn a lot about numbers, how to use them, and how to write computer programs.

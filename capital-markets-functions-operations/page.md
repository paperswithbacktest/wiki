An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is a common example where a company issues shares to the public for the first time.

Secondary markets, on the other hand, deal with the trading of existing securities. Here, investors buy and sell securities that have already been issued, providing liquidity to the market. This liquidity is crucial as it allows investors to easily enter and [exit](/wiki/exit-strategy) positions, thereby encouraging further investment. Stock exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ, are typical venues for secondary market transactions.

Capital markets play an integral role in the financial ecosystem by enhancing liquidity and making capital available for different sectors of the economy. By enabling the trade of stocks, bonds, and other securities, they support a wide range of investment opportunities. This function is essential for promoting economic expansion, as it allows both institutional and individual investors to diversify their portfolios, manage risk, and potentially earn returns on their investments.

Furthermore, capital markets contribute to the transparent and fair pricing of securities through the mechanisms of supply and demand. They also serve as a barometer for economic health by reflecting investors' perceptions of current economic conditions and future growth prospects. Effective regulation and oversight are crucial to maintaining the stability and integrity of these markets, ensuring that they operate efficiently and fairly for all participants.

In summary, capital markets are foundational components of the financial system, driving economic growth and development by facilitating the efficient allocation of resources. Their ability to provide liquidity, investment, and opportunities for risk management makes them indispensable in today's global economy.

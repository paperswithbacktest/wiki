## How secure is ItBit Exchange and what security measures do they have in place?

ItBit Exchange works hard to keep your money and information safe. They use strong security measures to protect against hackers and other bad people. ItBit keeps most of the money in special secure places that are not connected to the internet, which makes it very hard for hackers to steal.

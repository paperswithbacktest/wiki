## What is credit risk and why is it important?

Credit risk is the chance that a person or a company might not be able to pay back the money they borrowed. This can happen with loans, credit cards, or any other type of credit. When banks or other lenders give out money, they look at how likely it is that the borrower will pay it back. If the risk is too high, they might not lend the money or they might charge a higher interest rate to cover the risk.

Understanding credit risk is important for both lenders and borrowers. For lenders, like banks, it helps them decide if they should give out a loan and how much interest to charge. If they don't manage credit risk well, they could lose a lot of money. For borrowers, knowing about credit risk can help them understand why they might not get a loan or why they have to pay a high interest rate. It also encourages them to keep a good credit history so they can borrow money more easily in the future.

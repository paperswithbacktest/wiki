The high-frequency trading (HFT) platform requires a combination of software and hardware optimized for extremely fast execution speeds. The success of an HFT platform depends largely on its ability to process data and execute orders faster than its competitors. Here's the technology stack typically used in an HFT platform:

1. **Hardware**:
    - **Colocated servers**: These servers are physically located close to the exchange servers to minimize latency.
    - **Ultra-fast network**: Switches and routers specifically designed for low-latency operations.
    - **FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)** boards: These enable hardware logic to be programmed to perform specific functions at high speed.
2. **Programming languages**:
    - **C++**: Widely preferred for its real-time performance.
    - **Assembler**: In certain situations where extreme optimization is required, assembler can be used.
    - **Python** or **Java**: Can be used for less latency-sensitive parts.
3. **Database management systems**:
    - Ultra-fast databases, often customized or optimized, for fast data access.
4. **Communication protocols**:
    - **FIX (Financial Information eXchange)**: An industry-standard protocol for the exchange of financial transaction information.
    - **Proprietary protocols**: Some HFTs develop their own protocols to further reduce latency.
5. **Operating systems**:
    - Although standard versions of operating systems such as Linux are commonly used, they are often heavily modified to eliminate unnecessary latency.
    - **Real-time Linux**: A variant of Linux optimized to guarantee predictable response times (i.e. no unexpected delays).
6. **APIs and middleware**:
    - Ultra-fast APIs for real-time data capture and order execution.
    - Middleware optimized for high-speed message processing.
7. **Analysis and monitoring tools**:
    - Systems to monitor performance, latency, and to ensure that everything works as expected.

It is essential to note that technology alone does not guarantee success in HFT. Trading strategy, infrastructure and the ability to respond quickly to market changes are also crucial. In addition, financial market regulations are evolving, which can influence the approach and technology used in HFT.

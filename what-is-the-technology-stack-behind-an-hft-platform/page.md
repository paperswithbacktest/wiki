```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_var(returns, confidence_level=0.95, time_horizon=1):
    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of returns
    mean_return = np.mean(returns)
    std_dev = np.std(returns)

    # Calculate the z-score for the confidence level
    z_score = np.percentile(returns, (1 - confidence_level) * 100)

    # Calculate VaR
    var = - (mean_return + z_score * std_dev * np.sqrt(time_horizon))
    return var

# Example usage
returns = np.random.normal(0.01, 0.02, 1000)  # Simulated returns data
var = calculate_var(returns)
print(f"Value at Risk: {var:.2f}")
```

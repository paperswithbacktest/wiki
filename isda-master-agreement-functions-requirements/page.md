By using Confirmations, the parties can make sure that every trade is clearly documented and follows the rules set in the main agreement.

## What are the differences between the 1992 and 2002 versions of the ISDA Master Agreement?

## How does the ISDA Master Agreement address cross-border legal and regulatory issues?

The ISDA Master Agreement helps businesses deal with legal and regulatory issues when they trade derivatives across different countries. It does this by setting clear rules that both parties agree to follow, no matter where they are located. This makes it easier for companies from different countries to trade with each other because they know what to expect.

This way, they can make sure the agreement works well in both places.

Another way the ISDA Master Agreement handles cross-border issues is by having rules for what happens if there's a problem with the law in one country.

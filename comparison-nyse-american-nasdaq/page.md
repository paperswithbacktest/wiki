```python
# Example trend-following algorithm pseudocode

# Define moving average windows
short_window = 40
long_window = 100

# Initialize signals DataFrame
signals = pd.DataFrame(index=stock_data.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0

# Create short and long simple moving averages
signals['short_mavg'] = stock_data['price'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
signals['long_mavg'] = stock_data['price'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Generate buy/sell signals
signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

# Create trading orders
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
```

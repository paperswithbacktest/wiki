The Mont Pelerin Society is a group of people who think and talk about how to make the world's economy better. They started meeting in 1947 in a place called Mont Pelerin in Switzerland. The group was started by a man named Friedrich Hayek. He and others in the group believe in something called free market ideas. This means they think that people should be able to buy and sell things without too many rules from the government.

The people in the Mont Pelerin Society come from many different countries and have different jobs, like being teachers, writers, or business people. They meet every year to talk about big ideas like freedom, how to make money, and how governments should work.

## Who were the key founders of the Mont Pelerin Society?

The Mont Pelerin Society was founded by Friedrich Hayek, an economist from Austria. He wanted to bring together people who believed in free markets and less government control. Hayek thought that if people from different countries could talk and share ideas, they could help make the world's economy better. He invited other thinkers who agreed with his ideas to join him in starting the society.

Other important founders included economists like Milton Friedman from the United States and Karl Popper from Austria. These people were all interested in how to make life better for everyone by promoting freedom and reducing government rules. Together, they started the Mont Pelerin Society to discuss these big ideas and work towards a world with more economic freedom.

## What are the main ideological principles of the Mont Pelerin Society?

The Mont Pelerin Society believes in the idea of a free market, which means they think people should be able to buy and sell things without too many rules from the government. They believe that when people are free to make their own choices, the economy works better and everyone can have a better life. They also think that too many rules from the government can stop people from being creative and making money.

Another important idea for the Mont Pelerin Society is personal freedom. They believe that people should be able to live their lives the way they want, as long as they don't hurt others. They think that governments should be small and not control too much of people's lives.

Algorithmic trading, commonly called algo trading, has significantly transformed investor interactions with financial markets. This approach utilizes computer algorithms to execute trades at velocities and frequencies beyond human capability. The core advantage of algorithmic trading lies in its ability to process vast quantities of market data in real-time, identify trading opportunities, and execute trades almost instantaneously.

In 2020, the demand for algorithm-driven trading strategies saw substantial growth, primarily fueled by heightened market [volatility](/wiki/volatility-trading-strategies).

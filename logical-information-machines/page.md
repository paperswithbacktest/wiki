```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Sample data loading
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Feature selection and target variable setting
features = data[['indicator1', 'indicator2', 'indicator3']]
target = data['price_next_hour']

# Train-test split
train_features, test_features, train_target, test_target = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model initialization and training
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(train_features, train_target)

# Prediction
predictions = model.predict(test_features)

# Evaluation of model performance
print(f'Prediction Accuracy: {model.score(test_features, test_target) * 100:.2f}%')
```

This code snippet demonstrates how machine learning can be integrated with high-frequency data processing capabilities provided by LIM, thus empowering traders with tools to make informed decisions.

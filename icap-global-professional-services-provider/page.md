## The Evolution of ICAP

ICAP emerged as a dominant force in the interdealer brokerage industry through the strategic merger of Garban plc and Intercapital plc in 1999. This merger aimed to consolidate expertise and market presence, setting the stage for ICAP to become a leading entity in facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) trading across diverse financial products.

Throughout its growth, ICAP pursued a trajectory of strategic acquisitions to enhance its technological capabilities and market reach. Notably, the acquisition of BrokerTec and EBS marked significant milestones in this journey. BrokerTec, renowned for its electronic trading platforms for fixed income products, and EBS, a leading electronic trading platform for foreign exchange, bolstered ICAP's foray into electronic trading. These platforms collectively expanded ICAP's capabilities, enabling it to handle an impressive trading volume of over $2.3 trillion in daily transactions.

In 2016, ICAP underwent a transformative restructuring by selling its global broker business to Tullett Prebon. This strategic divestment resulted in the rebranding of ICAP's remaining operations as NEX Group. The rebranding was more than a mere name change; it represented ICAP's strategic pivot toward electronic markets and post-trade services. This shift was in response to the increasing demand for automated and efficient trading solutions in the financial services industry.

By focusing on electronic trading, NEX Group capitalized on the rising importance of technology-driven trading solutions, underscoring ICAP's commitment to innovation and adaptability. This strategic realignment allowed ICAP to specialize and refine its offerings in electronic platforms, catering to the evolving needs of the financial markets driven by automation and data analytics.

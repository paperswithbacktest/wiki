## How does the American Funds Investment Company of America handle dividends and capital gains?

The American Funds Investment Company of America pays out dividends and capital gains to its investors. Dividends are the money that companies pay out to their shareholders, and the fund collects these dividends from the stocks it owns.

This means that if you own shares in the fund, you will get some extra money from the dividends and capital gains.

You can choose what to do with the dividends and capital gains you get. You can take the money and use it however you want, or you can reinvest it back into the fund. If you reinvest, the fund will use that money to buy more shares for you. This can help your investment grow over time because you are putting more money into the fund without having to add any new money from your pocket. It's a good way to keep your investment growing, but it's up to you to decide what you want to do with the dividends and capital gains.

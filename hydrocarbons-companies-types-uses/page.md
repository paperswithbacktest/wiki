## Chemical Uses of Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons, simple organic compounds made only of hydrogen and carbon atoms, serve as the foundation for the world's most vital energy resources, such as oil, gas, and coal. These compounds are primarily classified into alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes, distinguished by the nature of the bonds between carbon atoms; alkanes have single bonds, alkenes have at least one double bond, and alkynes have one or more triple bonds. The high energy density and combustible nature of hydrocarbons make them invaluable for energy production. When hydrocarbons combust in the presence of oxygen, they produce carbon dioxide, water, and a substantial amount of energy:

$$
\text{CxHy} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{Energy}
$$

This reaction underpins their use as fuels in vehicles, power plants, and a variety of other applications, establishing hydrocarbons as a key element in the global energy supply chain.

Quantitative trading is a multidisciplinary field that blends elements of computer science, data science, statistics, finance, and often domain-specific expertise. However, the degree to which each of these disciplines is emphasized can vary based on the specific role and approach taken within quantitative trading. Let's break down the roles of computer science and data science/statistics in quantitative trading:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - **Algorithm Development**: Quantitative trading relies heavily on algorithms to execute trades, manage risk, and optimize portfolios. Designing and implementing these algorithms requires a strong foundation in computer science.
    - **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: Some quantitative trading strategies focus on making large numbers of trades in very short time frames, and this requires systems that can handle vast amounts of data at very high speeds.
    - **Infrastructure and Systems**: Quants often need to work closely with the systems on which their algorithms run, ensuring that their code is optimized for the specific hardware and software environments in which they operate.
2. **Data Science/Statistics**:
    - **Model Building**: Quantitative trading strategies are often based on statistical models that predict market movements. The development of these models requires expertise in statistics, econometrics, and data analysis.
    - **Data Processing**: Before models can be built, financial data often needs to be cleaned, processed, and transformed. This is a major component of the data science pipeline.
    - **Machine Learning**: With the rise of big data and advanced machine learning techniques, some quantitative trading strategies now employ complex machine learning models to predict market movements.

In practice, the boundaries between computer science and data science/statistics are not always clear-cut. For example, implementing a machine learning model efficiently for real-time trading might require deep knowledge in both domains. The best quantitative researchers and traders often have a mix of skills that span both computer science and data science/statistics.

However, if you're trying to determine which discipline to focus on for a career in quantitative trading, it depends on what you want your role to be:

- If you're more interested in designing and implementing trading algorithms, optimizing code, and dealing with the technical details of the trading infrastructure, then a stronger focus on **computer science** might be beneficial.
- If you're more interested in researching trading strategies, analyzing financial data, and building predictive models, then a foundation in **data science and statistics** would be more relevant.

In any case, having a blend of both will be advantageous in the ever-evolving world of quantitative trading.

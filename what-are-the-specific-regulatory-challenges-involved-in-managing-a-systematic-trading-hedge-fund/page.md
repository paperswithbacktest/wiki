Running a systematic trading hedge fund involves a number of regulatory challenges. Financial regulators around the world have imposed strict frameworks for investment funds to protect investors and ensure market integrity. Here are the main regulatory challenges specific to a systematic trading hedge fund:

1. **Registration and Licensing**: Before starting to operate, a hedge fund must generally register with local regulatory authorities. This registration can be complex, requiring detailed documentation on the fund, its managers, and its strategies.
2. **Compliance with Reporting Standards**: Systematic trading hedge funds are often required to submit regular reports on their activities, performance, and risk exposures. These reports must be accurate and comply with regulatory standards.
3. **Transparency**: Regulators require transparency in fund operations and strategies. Although hedge funds are not always required to disclose all the details of their strategies, they must be transparent about the associated risks and how they manage these risks.
4. **Risk Management**: A robust risk management framework is essential. Regulators expect hedge funds to have systems in place to identify, assess, and mitigate risks.
5. **Leverage restrictions**: Some regulators impose limits on the amount of leverage a hedge fund can use. This is intended to limit systemic risks for the financial system as a whole.
6. **Trading practices**: Systematic trading hedge funds must ensure that their trading strategies and practices comply with all regulations, including those concerning market manipulation, high-frequency trading, and market abuse.
7. **Investor Protection**: Strict rules are in place to protect the rights and interests of investors. This includes rules on how funds are marketed and how information is disclosed to investors.
8. **Restrictions on Investor Types**: In some jurisdictions, hedge funds are restricted to qualified or accredited investors, thus excluding retail investors.
9. **Record Keeping**: Funds are often required to keep detailed records of their transactions, communications, and decisions for a certain period of time.
10. **Cross-border regulations**: For hedge funds operating in several jurisdictions, compliance with multiple sets of regulations can pose considerable challenges.

In conclusion, managing a **systematic trading hedge fund** requires in-depth knowledge of regulatory challenges and constant diligence to ensure compliance. Managers must work closely with legal experts to navigate this complex and ever-changing landscape.

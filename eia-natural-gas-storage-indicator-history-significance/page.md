```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Sample historical data (replace with actual EIA data)
storage_levels = np.array([[1000], [1100], [1200], [1300], [1400]])  # Example storage levels
prices = np.array([2.5, 2.6, 2.8, 3.0, 3.2])  # Corresponding gas prices

# Splitting data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(storage_levels, prices, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initializing and training the Random Forest model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the prices for the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluating the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

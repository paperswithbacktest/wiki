## What is the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)?

The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is a place where people can buy and sell shares of companies in Thailand. It started in 1975 and helps companies get money to grow their business by selling parts of their company to the public. People who buy these shares become part owners of the company and can make money if the company does well.

The SET is important for Thailand's economy because it helps businesses get the money they need to expand and create jobs. It also gives people a chance to invest their money and possibly earn more. The SET has rules to make sure trading is fair and safe for everyone involved.

## How was the Stock Exchange of Thailand established?

The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) was set up in 1975. Before that, there was no place in Thailand where people could easily buy and sell shares of companies. The government wanted to help businesses grow and give people a way to invest their money. So, they decided to create the SET. It took some time to plan and build, but finally, on April 30, 1975, the SET opened its doors for trading.

At first, the SET had only 14 companies listed. This means only 14 companies had their shares available for people to buy and sell. Over time, more and more companies joined the SET. Today, there are hundreds of companies listed on the SET. The SET has grown a lot since it started and has become an important part of Thailand's economy. It helps businesses get money to grow and gives people a chance to invest and possibly earn more money.

## What are the main indices of the SET?

The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has a few important indices that help people understand how the market is doing. The main index is called the SET Index. It shows how the overall market is performing by looking at the prices of the biggest and most traded companies on the SET. When the SET Index goes up, it usually means that the market is doing well. When it goes down, it means the market is not doing as well.

Another important index is the SET50 Index. This index focuses on the 50 biggest and most liquid companies on the SET. These are companies that are easy to buy and sell shares in. The SET50 Index is useful for investors who want to know how the biggest companies in Thailand are doing. It can help them make decisions about where to put their money.

There's also the mai Index, which stands for the Market for Alternative Investment. This index tracks companies that are smaller and newer than those on the main SET. The mai Index helps investors see how these smaller companies are doing. It's a good way to find out about up-and-coming businesses in Thailand.

## How can someone invest in the Stock Exchange of Thailand?

To invest in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), you need to open a trading account with a brokerage firm. A brokerage firm is a company that helps you buy and sell shares. You can find many brokerage firms in Thailand, and some of them even have online platforms that make it easy to trade from your computer or phone. Once you have an account, you can put money into it and start buying shares of companies listed on the SET. It's important to do some research first to understand which companies you want to invest in and how much money you want to spend.

After you've bought shares, you can keep them for a long time or sell them whenever you want. If the company does well, the price of its shares might go up, and you can make money by selling them for more than you paid. But remember, the price can also go down, so there's a risk you might lose money. It's a good idea to keep learning about the companies you invest in and to think about your goals and how much risk you're willing to take. Investing in the SET can be a way to grow your money over time, but it's important to be careful and make smart choices.

## What are the trading hours of the SET?

The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is open for trading from Monday to Friday. The trading hours are from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM, and then it opens again from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM. This means there is a break in the middle of the day when the market is closed.

During these hours, people can buy and sell shares of companies listed on the SET. It's important to know these times if you want to trade because you can only do it when the market is open. If you miss the trading hours, you'll have to wait until the next day to make your trades.

## What types of securities are traded on the SET?

The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is a place where people can trade different kinds of securities. The main type of security traded on the SET is stocks, which are shares of companies. When you buy a stock, you become a part owner of that company. The SET also has other types of securities like bonds. Bonds are like loans that you give to a company or the government, and they pay you back with interest over time.

Another type of security you can find on the SET is investment units from mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These are collections of different investments put together by professionals. When you buy a unit, you're investing in all the things in the fund. The SET also has derivatives, which are more complex securities. Derivatives are contracts that get their value from something else, like the price of a stock or a commodity. They can be used to bet on the future price of things or to protect against risks.

## How does the SET contribute to the Thai economy?

The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) helps the Thai economy by giving companies a place to get money. When companies want to grow bigger, they can sell shares on the SET. People buy these shares, and the money goes to the company. This helps the company build new things, hire more people, and make more products. When companies do well, they create jobs and help the economy grow. The SET is like a big helper that makes it easier for companies to find the money they need.

The SET also helps people save and invest their money. When people buy shares, they hope the price will go up so they can sell them later for more money. This can help people save for the future, like for buying a house or retiring. When people invest in the SET, they are putting their money into the Thai economy. This can make the economy stronger because more money is moving around and being used to build things. So, the SET is important for both companies and people in Thailand.

## What are the requirements for a company to be listed on the SET?

To be listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), a company needs to meet certain rules. First, the company must have been in business for at least three years. This shows that the company has a good history and is not brand new. The company also needs to make enough money. It should have made a profit in the last two years and have a certain amount of money left after paying all its bills. This makes sure the company is strong and can handle being on the SET.

Another important rule is that the company must have enough shares to sell to the public. At least 25% of its shares need to be available for people to buy. This helps make sure there are enough shares for people to trade. The company also needs to follow all the laws and rules set by the SET and the government. This includes being honest about its business and finances. If a company can meet all these rules, it can apply to be listed on the SET and start selling its shares to the public.

## How is the performance of the SET measured and reported?

These indices help investors see how different parts of the market are performing.

The SET reports its performance every day. At the end of each trading day, the SET publishes the closing values of its indices.

The SEC makes sure that the SET follows all the rules and that trading is fair and safe for everyone. They check that companies tell the truth about their business and finances. If a company does something wrong, the SEC can punish them to protect investors.

Another important group is the SET itself. The SET has its own rules that companies must follow to be listed and to keep trading. They watch the market every day to make sure everything is going smoothly. If they see something strange, they can stop trading or ask for more information. Both the SEC and the SET work together to make sure the stock market in Thailand is a good place for companies and investors.

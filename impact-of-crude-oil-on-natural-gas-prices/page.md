```python
# Example of a simple algorithmic trading strategy in Python using a moving average crossover

import pandas as pd

# Load historical data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv')

# Calculate moving averages
data['Short_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=30).mean()
data['Long_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=90).mean()

# Generate trading signals
data['Signal'] = 0
data.loc[data['Short_MA'] > data['Long_MA'], 'Signal'] = 1
data.loc[data['Short_MA'] < data['Long_MA'], 'Signal'] = -1

# Execute trades based on signals
def execute_trades(data):
    for i in range(1, len(data)):
        if data['Signal'].iloc[i] == 1 and data['Signal'].iloc[i-1] == -1:
            print(f"Buy at {data['Close'].iloc[i]}")
        elif data['Signal'].iloc[i] == -1 and data['Signal'].iloc[i-1] == 1:

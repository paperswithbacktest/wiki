This data is then analyzed using advanced algorithms that apply statistical and [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning) techniques to identify patterns or trends that can inform trading decisions. For instance, a common algorithmic strategy might involve using a moving average crossover to signal potential buy or sell points.

Mathematically, such strategies can be represented by:

$$
\text{Signal} = \begin{cases} 
\text{Buy,} & \text{if } MA_{\text{short-term}} > MA_{\text{long-term}} \\
\text{Sell,} & \text{if } MA_{\text{short-term}} < MA_{\text{long-term}}
\end{cases}
$$

Here, $MA_{\text{short-term}}$ and $MA_{\text{long-term}}$ are the short-term and long-term moving averages, respectively.

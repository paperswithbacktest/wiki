import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load historical market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')
prices = data['Close'].values

# Define features and target
X = np.array(range(len(prices))).reshape(-1, 1)
y = prices

# Train a simple linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict future prices
future_prices = model.predict(X)

# Make trading decisions based on predictions
def trade(prices, future_prices):
    for i in range(len(prices)):
        if future_prices[i] > prices[i]:
            print(f"Day {i}: Buy")
        else:

## What is natural gas and why is it important?

Natural gas is a type of fuel that comes from deep under the ground. It is made up mostly of a gas called methane, but it can also have other gases mixed in. People find natural gas by drilling into the earth, similar to how they find oil. Once they find it, they can use pipes to bring it to homes and businesses.

Natural gas is important because it is used to make heat and electricity. Many people use it in their homes to cook food and keep warm. It is also used in factories to make things like plastic and fertilizer. Natural gas is considered a cleaner fuel than coal and oil because it makes less pollution when burned. This makes it a popular choice for helping to keep the air clean while still meeting our energy needs.

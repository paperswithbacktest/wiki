market_data = pd.Series([/* real-time market data goes here */])

# Compute moving averages
short_window = calculate_moving_average(market_data, window_size=5)
long_window = calculate_moving_average(market_data, window_size=20)

# Simple trading signal
signals = np.where(short_window > long_window, 1, 0)

# Execute trades based on signals
for i in range(len(signals)):
    if signals[i]:
        print("Buy signal at index:", i)

    new_speed_ghz = base_speed_ghz * speed_increase_factor
    return new_speed_ghz

# Example usage
base_speed = 3.0  # in GHz
new_node_size = 3  # hypothetical future node size in nm
enhanced_speed = processing_speed(new_node_size, base_speed)
print(f"Enhanced Speed: {enhanced_speed:.2f} GHz")

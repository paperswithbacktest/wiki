You can get these from a big online market called a cryptocurrency exchange, like Coinbase or Binance. Once you have ETH or BTC, you can go to a special kind of market called a decentralized exchange, like SushiSwap or Uniswap. On these platforms, you can trade your ETH or BTC for SUSHI tokens. Just follow the steps on the website to make the trade, and the SUSHI tokens will show up in your online wallet.

To store SUSHI tokens safely, you need a special kind of online wallet that can hold different cryptocurrencies. There are two main types of wallets: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, like the ones you can use on your phone or computer, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. They are easy to use but can be risky if your device gets hacked. Cold wallets, like hardware wallets such as Ledger or Trezor, are not connected to the internet, which makes them much safer. You can move your SUSHI tokens to a cold wallet for long-term storage to keep them secure.

The total supply of SUSHI tokens is 249,197,760. This number is set and won't change. The way these tokens are shared out is important because it helps the SushiSwap platform work well and keeps everyone interested in helping it grow.

Over time, more SUSHI tokens are given out to people who keep their money in the platform's market. This helps keep the platform running smoothly. Also, some SUSHI tokens are used for special projects and to reward people who help make SushiSwap better. This way, everyone can benefit from being part of the SushiSwap community.

## What role do liquidity providers play in SushiSwap?

Liquidity providers are really important for SushiSwap. They help make trading easier by adding their own cryptocurrencies to the platform's big pool of money, called a liquidity pool. When someone wants to trade one cryptocurrency for another, they can use the money in this pool. By adding their money to the pool, liquidity providers make sure there's always enough money available for people to trade with. In return, they get SUSHI tokens as a reward for helping the platform work well.

These SUSHI tokens are not just a thank you; they also let liquidity providers have a say in how SushiSwap is run. If you have SUSHI tokens, you can vote on changes and improvements to the platform. This means that the people who help keep the platform running smoothly can also help decide its future. By [earning](/wiki/earning-announcement) more SUSHI tokens over time, liquidity providers are encouraged to keep their money in the pool, which helps keep the platform strong and active.

## How does SushiSwap's yield farming work?

Yield farming on SushiSwap is a way for people to earn more SUSHI tokens by helping the platform. When you add your cryptocurrency to the big pool of money on SushiSwap, you become a liquidity provider. This pool is used by other people to trade different cryptocurrencies. By adding your money to the pool, you help make trading easier for everyone. In return, SushiSwap gives you SUSHI tokens as a reward. The more money you add to the pool and the longer you keep it there, the more SUSHI tokens you can earn.

## What are the risks associated with investing in SUSHI?

Investing in SUSHI, like any cryptocurrency, comes with risks. One big risk is that the value of SUSHI can go up and down a lot. This means you could lose money if the price goes down after you buy it. Also, because SUSHI is part of a new and growing platform, there can be problems or mistakes that affect its value. For example, if something goes wrong with SushiSwap, it could make SUSHI less valuable.

Another risk is that cryptocurrencies like SUSHI can be hacked or stolen. If you keep your SUSHI tokens in a hot wallet, which is connected to the internet, there's a chance someone could break into your wallet and take your tokens. Even if you use a cold wallet, which is safer, there's still a small risk of losing your tokens if you lose the wallet or forget the password. It's important to be careful and use strong security to protect your SUSHI tokens.

## How has the governance of Sushi (SUSHI) evolved over time?

When Sushi (SUSHI) first started, the way it was run was pretty simple. The person who created it, Chef Nomi, had a lot of control over how things worked. But as more people started using SushiSwap and earning SUSHI tokens, they wanted to have a say in how the platform was run. So, the governance of Sushi changed to let people with SUSHI tokens vote on important decisions. This made SushiSwap more like a community project where everyone could help decide its future.

Over time, the way Sushi is governed has become more organized and clear. Now, there's a special group called the Sushi DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) that helps make big decisions. People with SUSHI tokens can vote on things like new features, changes to the platform, and how to use the money SushiSwap makes. This has made SushiSwap a place where everyone can help and benefit, and it keeps getting better because the community is in charge.

## What are some major partnerships or integrations involving SushiSwap?

By working together, SushiSwap and Yearn Finance made it easier for people to use both platforms and get more rewards. Another big integration is with Chainlink, which helps SushiSwap get important information from the real world, like prices of cryptocurrencies. This makes trading on SushiSwap more accurate and trustworthy.

These partnerships and integrations show how SushiSwap is growing and working with other projects to make the whole cryptocurrency world better for everyone.

## What future developments are planned for Sushi (SUSHI) and SushiSwap?

SushiSwap wants to work with more platforms like Yearn Finance, Chainlink, and Aave to bring new features and benefits to its users.

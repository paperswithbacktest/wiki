To illustrate how algo trading might incorporate both AI and blockchain, consider a Python-based example where an algorithm uses machine learning to predict stock prices and executes trades on a blockchain-enabled exchange:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import blockchain_trading_platform  # Hypothetical library

# Generate synthetic data for stock prices
dates = np.arange(1, 101).reshape(-1, 1)
prices = np.random.normal(loc=100, scale=10, size=(100,))

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(dates, prices)

# Predict future price
future_date = np.array([[102]])
predicted_price = model.predict(future_date)

# Place a trade if the predicted price indicates potential profit
if predicted_price > 105:
    blockchain_trading_platform.place_trade(asset='ETF_Tech', action='buy', amount=100)
```

This simplified example demonstrates how an algorithm can predict potential price movements and then execute a buy order on a blockchain-based platform if the forecast suggests profitability.

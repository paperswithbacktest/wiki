Both types of accounts are easy to use and can help people grow their money.

## What are the fee structures associated with Ally Invest accounts?

Ally Invest has low fees which makes it easier for people to invest without spending too much money. For self-directed accounts, there are no fees to open an account.

If you want to trade mutual funds, there is a $9.95 fee per trade for no-load funds. There are also no account maintenance fees or inactivity fees, so you don't have to worry about extra costs if you're not trading often.

## How does Ally Invest compare to other major online brokerages in terms of cost and features?

Ally Invest is known for its low costs and easy-to-use platform, which makes it a good choice for people who are just starting to invest. When you compare it to other major online brokerages like Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and E*TRADE, Ally Invest stands out because it doesn't charge any fees for trading stocks and ETFs. This is similar to what other big brokerages offer, but Ally Invest also has low fees for options trades at $0.50 per contract, which can be cheaper than some competitors. For example, E*TRADE charges $0.65 per options contract. Ally Invest also doesn't have any account maintenance or inactivity fees, which is great if you don't trade often. On the other hand, some brokerages might charge you for not using your account enough.

In terms of features, Ally Invest has a lot to offer but it might not have as many advanced tools as some of the bigger brokerages. Ally Invest's platform is simple and user-friendly, with tools like charts, watchlists, and a practice account for learning. This is good for beginners. However, if you're an experienced investor looking for more advanced features, you might find that Charles Schwab or Fidelity offer more detailed research and analysis tools. Ally Invest's robo-advisor, Managed Portfolios, is also a bit pricier than some competitors. For example, Betterment charges 0.25% for all account sizes, while Ally Invest's fee is 0.30% for accounts under $25,000. Overall, Ally Invest is a solid choice for those who want low costs and a straightforward platform, but it might not meet the needs of investors looking for more advanced features or the lowest robo-advisor fees.

## What are the security measures in place at Ally Invest to protect investor assets and data?

Ally Invest takes security very seriously to keep your money and information safe. They use something called two-[factor](/wiki/factor-investing) authentication, which means you need two ways to prove it's really you when you log in. This makes it harder for someone else to get into your account. They also use strong encryption to protect your data when it's sent over the internet. This is like putting your information in a special code that only Ally Invest can understand. Plus, they have systems that watch for anything unusual, like if someone tries to log in from a strange place or make a big withdrawal.

Another way Ally Invest keeps your money safe is by following rules from the government. They are part of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which means if Ally Invest ever has big problems, the SIPC can help protect your investments up to $500,000, including $250,000 in cash. Ally Invest also has extra insurance from a company called Lloyd's of London, which adds more protection on top of what the SIPC offers. This extra insurance can cover up to $50 million, which gives you even more peace of mind that your money is safe.

## How does Ally Invest's robo-advisor service work and what are its benefits?

You can see different time periods and use different ways to look at the data, like lines, bars, or candles. This can help you understand how investments might do in the future. Ally Invest also lets you use "Conditional Orders," which means you can set up trades to happen only if certain things happen.

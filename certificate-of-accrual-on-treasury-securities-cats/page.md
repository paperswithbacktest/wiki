## What is a Certificate of Accrual on Treasury Securities (CATS)?

A Certificate of Accrual on Treasury Securities, or CATS, is a type of bond that is created from Treasury securities. It's a way to invest in government bonds but in a different form. Instead of getting regular interest payments like you would with a normal bond, with CATS, you buy them at a lower price and then get one big payment when they mature. This big payment includes all the interest that has built up over time.

CATS are popular because they are very safe since they are backed by the U.S. government. They are also good for people who want to know exactly how much money they will get at the end and don't need regular income from their investments. This makes them a good choice for saving for something specific in the future, like a big purchase or retirement.

## How do CATS differ from traditional Treasury securities?

CATS are different from traditional Treasury securities because they don't give you interest payments along the way. When you buy a traditional Treasury security, like a Treasury bond, you get interest payments every six months until the bond matures. With CATS, you buy them for less than what they're worth and then get all your money, including the interest, in one payment when they mature. This makes CATS a bit like zero-coupon bonds.

Another way CATS differ is that they can be a better fit for certain goals. If you're saving up for something specific down the road, like buying a house or funding your retirement, CATS can be a good choice. You know exactly how much money you'll get at the end, which helps with planning. Traditional Treasury securities might be better if you need regular income because they give you those interest payments over time. So, it really depends on what you're looking to do with your money.

## What are the benefits of investing in CATS?

One big benefit of investing in CATS is their safety. Since they are backed by the U.S. government, they are very secure. This means you don't have to worry about losing your money, which can be a big relief if you're saving for something important. Another advantage is that CATS are sold at a discount and then pay you a lump sum at maturity. This can be great if you're planning for a future expense, like buying a house or funding your retirement, because you know exactly how much money you'll get at the end.

Another benefit is that CATS can help you with your tax planning. Even though you don't get interest payments along the way, the interest that builds up each year is still considered income for tax purposes. This means you can plan your taxes better, knowing exactly how much interest you'll need to report each year. Plus, if you hold onto CATS until they mature, you might be able to use them in certain tax strategies, like offsetting gains with losses from other investments.

## Who typically invests in CATS?

People who invest in CATS are usually looking for a safe place to put their money. They might be saving up for something big, like buying a house or planning for retirement. These investors like knowing exactly how much money they'll get at the end, which helps them plan better. CATS are good for them because they are backed by the U.S. government, so there's very little risk of losing money.

Some investors also choose CATS because they want to do some tax planning. Even though CATS don't pay interest until they mature, the interest that builds up each year still counts as income for taxes. This can help people plan their taxes better because they know exactly how much interest they'll need to report each year. This makes CATS a good choice for people who like to be organized with their finances and taxes.

## How are CATS structured and how do they mature?

CATS are made from Treasury securities. When you buy a CATS, you pay less than what it's worth. This is called buying at a discount. You don't get any interest payments while you own it. Instead, all the interest builds up over time. When the CATS matures, you get one big payment. This payment includes the amount you paid for it plus all the interest that has built up.

The way CATS mature is simple. They have a set date when they will mature, which can be anywhere from a few months to many years in the future. On that date, you get your money back, plus all the interest that has been added up over time. This makes CATS a good choice if you're saving for something specific in the future because you know exactly how much money you'll get on that date.

## What is the process for purchasing CATS?

To buy CATS, you usually need to go through a broker or a financial institution that deals with government securities. You can start by contacting a bank or a brokerage firm to see if they offer CATS. Once you've found a place that sells them, you'll need to open an account if you don't already have one. Then, you can tell the broker how much you want to invest and they'll help you buy the CATS at the current market price.

After you've bought the CATS, you'll get a confirmation of your purchase. This will show you how many CATS you've bought, the price you paid, and the date when they will mature. You don't need to do anything else until they mature. On the maturity date, the money will be automatically deposited into your account. It's a simple process, and once you've bought the CATS, you can just wait for them to mature and get your big payment at the end.

## What are the risks associated with investing in CATS?

One risk with CATS is interest rate risk. If interest rates go up after you buy CATS, the value of your CATS might go down. This is because new CATS would be issued at higher interest rates, making the ones you bought less attractive to other investors. If you need to sell your CATS before they mature, you might get less money than you expected. However, if you hold onto your CATS until they mature, you won't lose money because you'll get the full amount you were promised.

Another risk is inflation. If inflation goes up a lot while you're waiting for your CATS to mature, the money you get at the end might not be worth as much as you thought it would be. This means your investment might not keep up with the rising costs of things. CATS don't pay interest along the way, so you don't get any money to spend or reinvest until they mature, which can be a long time. This makes CATS a bit riskier if you're worried about inflation eating away at your savings.

## How does the interest accrual work with CATS?

When you buy CATS, you're buying them at a lower price than what they'll be worth when they mature. This difference between what you pay and what you get at the end is the interest that builds up over time. It's like the interest is added to the CATS every day, but you don't get to see it until the CATS mature. So, if you buy a CATS for $900 and it's worth $1,000 when it matures, the $100 difference is the interest you've earned.

Even though you don't get the interest until the end, it's still considered income for tax purposes. Every year, you have to report a part of that interest as income on your taxes, even though you don't actually get the money until the CATS mature. This means you need to keep track of how much interest is building up each year so you can report it correctly on your taxes.

## Can CATS be sold before maturity, and if so, how?

Yes, you can sell CATS before they mature. If you need your money back before the CATS are supposed to pay out, you can sell them to someone else. You'll need to go through a broker or a financial institution that deals with government securities. They will help you find a buyer and handle the sale for you. The price you get for your CATS will depend on what people are willing to pay at that time, which can be more or less than what you paid for them.

The price of CATS can change because of things like interest rates. If interest rates go up after you buy your CATS, the price you can sell them for might go down. This is because new CATS would be issued at higher interest rates, making the ones you have less attractive. So, if you sell your CATS before they mature, you might get more or less money than you expected, depending on the market conditions at the time.

## How do CATS fit into a diversified investment portfolio?

CATS can be a good part of a diversified investment portfolio because they are very safe. Since they are backed by the U.S. government, you don't have to worry about losing your money. This makes them a good choice if you want to balance out riskier investments like stocks or mutual funds. By including CATS in your portfolio, you can have a stable part that helps protect your overall savings.

Another reason CATS can fit well into a diversified portfolio is that they help with planning for the future. If you're saving up for something specific, like buying a house or retirement, CATS can be great. You know exactly how much money you'll get at the end, which helps you plan better. Plus, they don't pay interest along the way, so they can work well with other investments that do give you regular income. This way, you can have a mix of investments that meet different needs and goals.

## What has been the historical performance of CATS compared to other securities?

CATS have generally been a safe investment because they are backed by the U.S. government. This means they have a very low risk of default, which is when an investment doesn't pay back what it promised. Compared to other securities like stocks or corporate bonds, CATS usually offer lower returns. This is because they are safer, and investors don't need as much reward for taking on less risk. Over time, CATS have provided steady returns, but they might not grow as much as riskier investments like stocks, which can go up and down a lot but sometimes offer higher returns.

Looking at specific time periods, CATS have performed well during times of economic uncertainty. For example, during financial crises, investors often move their money into safer investments like CATS to protect their savings. This can cause the value of CATS to stay stable or even go up when other securities like stocks are falling. However, in times of strong economic growth, CATS might not keep up with the returns of stocks or other higher-risk investments. So, while CATS provide safety and predictability, their performance can be outpaced by riskier securities during good economic times.

## What advanced strategies can be used with CATS to optimize investment returns?

One advanced strategy to optimize returns with CATS is called laddering. This means you buy CATS that mature at different times. For example, you could buy some CATS that mature in one year, some in two years, and some in three years. This way, you get money back at different times, which can help you manage your cash flow better. It also lets you take advantage of different interest rates over time. If rates go up, you can reinvest the money from the CATS that mature earlier at the new, higher rates. This can help you earn more interest over time.

Another strategy is to use CATS for tax planning. Even though you don't get interest payments until CATS mature, the interest that builds up each year is still considered income for tax purposes. You can use this to your advantage by timing when you report this income. For example, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in a certain year, you might want to buy CATS that mature in that year so you can report the interest then. This can help you pay less in taxes overall. Also, if you have other investments that lose money, you can use those losses to offset the income from CATS, which can reduce your tax bill even more.

## What are Certificates of Accrual on Treasury Securities (CATS)?

Certificates of Accrual on Treasury Securities (CATS) represented a category of zero-coupon bonds introduced by Salomon Brothers between 1982 and 1986. These financial instruments offered a unique investment opportunity, distinct from conventional bonds primarily due to their zero-coupon nature. Zero-coupon bonds like CATS do not provide periodic interest payments known as coupons. Instead, they are sold at a significant discount from their face value, and the investor receives the full face value at the time of maturity. This difference between the purchase price and the face value represents the investor's return, essentially mimicking the effect of compounded interest.

To illustrate the financial mechanics behind zero-coupon bonds like CATS, consider the following formula for the bond's present value:

$$

PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} 
$$

where $PV$ is the present value or purchase price of the bond, $FV$ is the face value at maturity, $r$ is the yield to maturity (interest rate), and $n$ is the number of years until maturity.

For investors, the appeal of purchasing a zero-coupon bond lies in its predictability and the ability to lock in a certain yield over a specified term. CATS provided a distinct advantage by eliminating the reinvestment risk inherent in traditional bonds that pay periodic interest, as there are no interim cash flows subject to changing interest rates.

CATS were initially created by stripping the principal and the interest components of U.S. Treasury securities, allowing investors to purchase them separately. This innovation offered a new way for market participants to tailor their investment strategies around specific cash flow needs and [interest rate](/wiki/interest-rate-trading-strategies) expectations. Although CATS have been replaced by other financial products over time, their structure remains a testament to creative financial engineering, providing insightful lessons on how investment vehicles can be tailored to meet various economic environments and investor preferences.

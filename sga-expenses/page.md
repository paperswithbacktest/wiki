        'General Costs': [3000, 3200, 3100],
        'Administrative Costs': [1500, 1600, 1550]}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate total SG&A expenses for each month
df['Total SG&A'] = df['Selling Costs'] + df['General Costs'] + df['Administrative Costs']

# Display the DataFrame
print(df)
```

This approach not only enhances transparency but also enables firms to identify areas where costs can be cut or managed more efficiently. Understanding the components of SG&A allows algo trading firms to strategically allocate resources, thus ensuring both competitive edge and enhanced operational efficiency in a fast-paced market.

## FAQs

### What are the key differences between SG&A and COGS?

SG&A (Selling, General, and Administrative expenses) and COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) are both critical components of a company's financial statements, but they serve different purposes and are accounted for differently. 

SG&A expenses encompass costs related to selling products and managing operations, including salaries, rent, utilities, and marketing expenses. These expenses are generally indirect costs that are not tied directly to the production of goods or services. They are reflected on the income statement as part of operating expenses and are primarily concerned with maintaining the broader operational and administrative functions of a business.

In contrast, COGS represents the direct costs incurred in producing goods or services sold by a business. This includes the cost of materials, labor, and overhead directly attributed to the production process. COGS is subtracted from revenue to calculate the gross profit of a company.

Understanding the distinction is vital for accurate financial analysis and helps in determining a business's gross margin and operating efficiency. For instance, reducing COGS can directly improve gross profit, whereas decreasing SG&A impacts operating income.

### How can algorithmic trading firms reduce SG&A expenses effectively?

## What are the current challenges facing Canopy Growth and Tilray in the cannabis industry?

Canopy Growth and Tilray both face big challenges in the cannabis industry. One big problem is that the rules about cannabis change a lot. In some places, cannabis is legal for medical use, but not for fun. In other places, it's legal for both. This makes it hard for these companies to know where they can sell their products. Another challenge is that there are a lot of other companies trying to sell cannabis too. This means Canopy Growth and Tilray have to compete hard to keep their customers and make money.

Another challenge is that it costs a lot of money to grow and sell cannabis. Canopy Growth and Tilray have to spend a lot on research to make new products and on advertising to let people know about them. Sometimes, they spend more money than they make, which can make their stock prices go down. Also, in the United States, cannabis is still not legal everywhere, so these companies can't sell their main products there. This makes it harder for them to grow their business and make more money.

They also try to make new products, like edibles and drinks, but they focus a lot on meeting the needs of people who use cannabis for health reasons.

They will keep spending money on research to find new ways to use cannabis for health. Canopy Growth also wants to make more cannabis drinks because they think a lot of people will like them.

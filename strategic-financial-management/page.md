## How does strategic financial management differ from traditional financial management?

Strategic financial management and traditional financial management are both about handling a company's money, but they do it in different ways.

They use tools like risk assessments and financial models to see how likely these problems are and how bad they could be. By understanding these risks, the company can make plans to avoid them or handle them if they happen.

Once the risks are known, companies use different strategies to manage them. One way is to spread out their investments so that if one thing goes wrong, it doesn't hurt the whole business.

## What are the challenges faced by organizations when adopting strategic financial management?

One of the biggest challenges organizations face when adopting strategic financial management is getting everyone on board. It can be hard to change how people think and work, especially if they are used to doing things a certain way. Employees and managers might not see the value in strategic planning right away, and it takes time and effort to convince them. Also, it can be tough to gather all the information needed to make good plans. This means looking at a lot of data and understanding the market and the economy, which can be complicated.

Another challenge is the cost and resources needed to set up and maintain strategic financial management. It takes money to buy the right tools and hire people with the skills to use them.

This helps them make smart decisions about where to spend their money and how to grow.

Technology also makes it easier to keep track of how the business is doing and make changes when needed. With tools like dashboards and real-time reports, managers can see what's happening right away and adjust their plans quickly.

By using advanced analytics and technology, companies can manage their money more effectively, plan for the future, and keep growing steadily.

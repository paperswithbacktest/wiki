## Definition of Value-Based Investing

Value investing, often referred to simply as "Value", is a strategy that aims to invest in assets whose current price is lower than their fundamental or book value. The aim is to benefit from the convergence of the asset price towards its fundamental value over the long term.

Value investors believe that the market can sometimes be irrational. It tends to overreact to news, whether positive or negative, leading to price fluctuations that don't necessarily reflect an asset's true value. It's in these moments of market inefficiency that opportunities arise for value investors.

## Application to the equities market

Equities are one of the main assets where the value strategy is commonly applied. Due to their inherent volatility, equities often experience periods of overvaluation or undervaluation.

To determine whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued, investors rely on a series of indicators. The Price/Book (P/B) ratio is one of the most commonly used. It compares a company's market capitalization with its book value.

## Beyond equities: Other assets

While equities are the main playground for value investors, this strategy can also be applied to other assets.

### Currencies

Purchasing power parity is often used as an indicator of a currency's value. If a currency is undervalued according to this theory, it could be a good candidate for value investing.

### Bonds

When it comes to investing in bonds using the value strategy, several factors come into play, such as credit risk, interest rate, liquidity risk, and tax differences.

## Value in the context of algo trading

With the development of algo trading, value-based strategy has been integrated into many algorithms. Using quantitative models, traders can quickly identify undervalued or overvalued assets, enabling rapid and optimized trade execution.

## Conclusion

The value-based investment strategy is a mainstay of quantitative trading. It offers a rational approach in a sometimes irrational market, providing opportunities for traders who know where to look. With the advent of algo trading, this traditional strategy has found a new lease of life, proving once again its timelessness and relevance. For those looking to get started in algorithmic trading, understanding and applying the value-based strategy can prove invaluable.

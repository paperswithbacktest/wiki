## What is Single Monthly Mortality (SMM)?

Single Monthly Mortality (SMM) is a measure used in finance to show the rate at which loans in a pool are paid off or defaulted on each month. It's important for understanding how quickly the loans in mortgage-backed securities or other loan pools are being paid down. The SMM is expressed as a percentage and helps investors predict the cash flow they will receive from these securities.

To calculate the SMM, you start with the total amount of principal paid off in a month, including both scheduled payments and any additional payments or defaults. You then divide this amount by the total outstanding principal at the beginning of the month. The result is then multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage. This simple calculation gives investors a clear picture of the monthly reduction in the loan pool's balance.

## How is SMM calculated?

Single Monthly Mortality (SMM) is a way to figure out how much of a loan pool's balance goes away each month. This includes money paid back on time, extra payments, and loans that don't get paid at all. To find the SMM, you start by adding up all the principal that was paid off in a month. This means you count both the regular payments people make and any extra money they pay, plus any loans that went bad.

Next, you take that total amount of principal paid off and divide it by the total amount of money that was owed at the start of the month. After you do this division, you multiply the result by 100 to turn it into a percentage. This percentage is the SMM, and it tells investors how fast the loans in a pool are being paid off or going bad each month.

## Why is SMM important in mortgage-backed securities?

Single Monthly Mortality (SMM) is really important for people who invest in mortgage-backed securities. These securities are made up of a bunch of home loans put together into one big package. The SMM helps investors know how quickly the people who borrowed the money are paying it back, or if they're not paying at all. This is key because it affects how much money investors will get back and when they'll get it.

Knowing the SMM helps investors plan better. If the SMM is high, it means the loans are being paid off faster, so investors might get their money back sooner. But if the SMM is low, it could mean the loans are taking longer to pay off, or more people are not paying their loans. This can change how much money investors expect to make and how they manage their investments.

## What is the relationship between SMM and prepayment speed?

Single Monthly Mortality (SMM) and prepayment speed are closely related because both deal with how quickly loans in a pool are being paid off. SMM looks at the total amount of principal paid off each month, including both regular payments and any extra payments people make. Prepayment speed, on the other hand, focuses on how fast people are paying off their loans earlier than they have to. When people pay off their loans faster, this increases the SMM because more principal is being paid off each month.

Understanding the relationship between SMM and prepayment speed helps investors predict the cash flow from mortgage-backed securities. If prepayments are high, the SMM will be higher too, meaning the loans are being paid off more quickly. This can affect how much money investors get back and when they get it. So, by keeping an eye on both SMM and prepayment speed, investors can better manage their investments and plan for the future.

## How does SMM impact the yield of a mortgage-backed security?

Single Monthly Mortality (SMM) can affect how much money investors make from mortgage-backed securities. When the SMM is high, it means that more of the loans in the pool are being paid off each month. This can be good for investors because they get their money back faster, but it also means the security might not last as long as expected. If people are paying off their loans quickly, the total amount of interest that the investors earn could be less because the loans are gone sooner.

On the other hand, if the SMM is low, it means that the loans are taking longer to be paid off. This can be good for investors if they want to keep [earning](/wiki/earning-announcement) interest over a longer time. But it also means they have to wait longer to get their money back. So, the SMM is important because it helps investors figure out how much money they might make and when they'll get it back.

## Can you explain the difference between SMM and Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR)?

Single Monthly Mortality (SMM) and Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR) are two ways to measure how quickly loans in a pool are being paid off, but they look at things a bit differently. SMM is a monthly rate that shows the percentage of the loan pool's balance that is paid off each month. This includes regular payments, extra payments people make, and any loans that don't get paid at all. So, SMM gives you a snapshot of what's happening each month.

CPR, on the other hand, is an annual rate that focuses just on how fast people are paying off their loans earlier than they have to. It doesn't include the regular payments people make, just the extra payments. To figure out the CPR, you start with the SMM and then use it to calculate what the yearly rate of these extra payments would be. Both SMM and CPR are important for investors in mortgage-backed securities because they help predict how much money they'll get and when they'll get it.

## How do changes in interest rates affect SMM?

Changes in interest rates can have a big impact on Single Monthly Mortality (SMM). When interest rates go down, people often want to pay off their old loans faster so they can take out new loans with lower rates. This means more people might make extra payments on their loans, which makes the SMM go up. On the other hand, if interest rates go up, people are less likely to pay off their loans early because they won't want to take out new loans at higher rates. So, the SMM might go down because fewer people are making extra payments.

This relationship between interest rates and SMM is important for investors in mortgage-backed securities. If interest rates drop and the SMM goes up, the loans in the pool might get paid off faster than expected. This can mean investors get their money back sooner, but they might also earn less interest overall because the loans don't last as long. If interest rates rise and the SMM goes down, the loans might take longer to pay off, which could be good for investors who want to keep earning interest over a longer time.

## What are common factors that influence SMM?

Several things can affect how quickly people pay off their loans, which is what SMM measures. One big thing is interest rates. If interest rates go down, more people might want to pay off their old loans faster so they can get new loans with lower rates. This makes the SMM go up because more people are making extra payments. On the other hand, if interest rates go up, people might not want to pay off their loans early because new loans would be more expensive. So, the SMM could go down because fewer people are making extra payments.

Another [factor](/wiki/factor-investing) that can change SMM is the economy. When the economy is doing well, people might have more money to pay off their loans faster, which would make the SMM go up. But if the economy is struggling, people might not have as much money, so they might not pay off their loans as quickly. This would make the SMM go down. Also, things like how easy it is to refinance a loan or how people feel about the future can affect how fast they pay off their loans, which in turn affects the SMM.

## How can investors use SMM to assess risk?

Investors can use Single Monthly Mortality (SMM) to understand how risky their investments in mortgage-backed securities might be. SMM tells them how quickly the loans in the pool are being paid off each month. If the SMM is high, it means people are paying off their loans faster. This could be good because investors get their money back sooner, but it also means they might earn less interest overall because the loans don't last as long. A high SMM can make the investment less predictable and more risky if investors were counting on earning interest over a longer time.

On the other hand, a low SMM means the loans are being paid off more slowly. This can be good for investors who want to keep earning interest over a longer period. But it also means they have to wait longer to get their money back, which can be risky if they need the money sooner. By watching the SMM, investors can see if the loans are being paid off faster or slower than they expected, which helps them figure out how much risk they're taking and adjust their investment plans accordingly.

## What are the limitations of using SMM as a metric?

Using Single Monthly Mortality (SMM) as a way to measure how quickly loans are paid off can be helpful, but it has its limits. One big problem is that SMM looks at what happens in just one month. This can make it hard to see the bigger picture because loan payments can change a lot from month to month. For example, if a lot of people decide to pay off their loans early one month because of lower interest rates, the SMM might be high that month but could go back to normal the next month. So, using SMM alone might not give a full understanding of how loans are being paid off over time.

Another limitation is that SMM doesn't tell the whole story about why loans are being paid off. It just shows that loans are being paid, but it doesn't explain if it's because people are making extra payments, refinancing, or if some loans are going bad. This can make it tough for investors to predict future cash flows accurately. They might see a high SMM and think it's all good news, but if it's because more loans are defaulting, that's actually bad news. So, while SMM is useful, investors need to look at other things too to get a complete picture of what's going on with their investments.

## How does SMM vary across different types of loans?

Single Monthly Mortality (SMM) can be different depending on what kind of loans are in the pool. For example, if the pool has a lot of home loans, the SMM might be affected by things like interest rates or how the economy is doing. Homeowners might pay off their loans faster if interest rates go down because they want to refinance and get a better deal. On the other hand, if the pool has a lot of car loans, the SMM might be different because people usually pay off car loans quicker than home loans. Also, car loans might not be as affected by changes in interest rates because people usually can't refinance car loans as easily as home loans.

Another thing that can make SMM different across loan types is how people feel about their money and the future. If people feel good about the economy and their jobs, they might pay off their loans faster, which would make the SMM go up. But if people are worried about losing their jobs or the economy getting worse, they might hold onto their money and not pay off their loans as quickly, which would make the SMM go down. So, the kind of loans in the pool and how people feel about their money can both change how the SMM looks.

## What advanced modeling techniques are used to predict SMM?

To predict Single Monthly Mortality (SMM), experts use fancy math and computer models that look at lots of different things at the same time. They might use something called regression analysis, which helps them see how things like interest rates, the economy, and how people feel about their money can affect how quickly loans get paid off. Another cool tool they use is [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning), which is like teaching a computer to find patterns in past data about loan payments. This can help them guess what might happen in the future with the SMM.

These models also take into account the type of loans in the pool. For example, home loans might act differently than car loans, so the models need to think about that. They might also use something called Monte Carlo simulations, which is a way of running lots of different scenarios to see what could happen with the SMM. By using all these advanced techniques together, experts can get a better idea of how the SMM might change and help investors make smarter choices about their money.

## What is Single Monthly Mortality (SMM)?

Single Monthly Mortality (SMM) is a metric used to measure the rate of prepayment within a pool of mortgages on a monthly basis. Unlike scheduled principal repayments, which are predetermined and expected over the life of a mortgage loan, SMM specifically addresses prepayments occurring beyond those scheduled amounts. These prepayments might arise from a variety of borrower behaviors, such as refinancing, selling a property, or opting to pay off a mortgage ahead of its term.

For investors in mortgage-backed securities (MBS), understanding SMM is essential due to its impact on expected returns. A key concern lies in the potential for early payoff of mortgages, which can lead to a decrease in anticipated interest income. Prepayments effectively shorten the life of the loan and thus the duration over which an investor receives interest payments, presenting a risk commonly referred to as "prepayment risk."

Mathematically, SMM is expressed as a percentage, calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{SMM} = \frac{\text{Actual Prepayment Amount}}{\text{Beginning Outstanding Balance}}
$$

where the "Actual Prepayment Amount" is the sum paid beyond any scheduled principal repayment for that month. Suppose a mortgage pool had a beginning outstanding balance of $100,000, with regular scheduled payments totaling $1,000. If an additional $1,500 is paid, representing an unscheduled payment, then the SMM would be:

$$
\text{SMM} = \frac{1500}{100000} = 0.015 \text{ or } 1.5\%
$$

The importance of SMM lies in its ability to provide a precise and clear measure of prepayment risk on a monthly basis. This allows MBS investors to gauge the frequency and likelihood of prepayments within their investment portfolio, enabling more accurate modeling of future cash flows and returns. By monitoring SMM trends, investors can adjust their strategies to mitigate potential impacts associated with varying prepayment behaviors, thus protecting or optimizing the value of their MBS investments.

## How can one calculate and understand SMM?

The calculation of Single Monthly Mortality (SMM) is a fundamental process critical for assessing prepayment risks in mortgage-backed securities. SMM is calculated by taking the actual principal payments made during a month, subtracting the scheduled principal payments, and then dividing the result by the outstanding balance at the start of the month. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
\text{SMM} = \frac{\text{Actual Principal Payments} - \text{Scheduled Principal Payments}}{\text{Outstanding Balance at the Start of the Month}}
$$

For example, consider a mortgage pool with an outstanding balance of $100,000 at the beginning of a month, with scheduled principal payments totaling $10,500, and actual payments amounting to $12,000. Substituting into the formula gives:

$$
\text{SMM} = \frac{12,000 - 10,500}{100,000} = 0.015 \text{ or } 1.51\%
$$

This example illustrates how SMM provides a straightforward percentage measure of the monthly prepayment rate beyond what was scheduled, highlighting the prepayment risk for investors holding MBS.

Moreover, SMM can be annualized into the Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR), allowing investors to assess prepayment trends over longer time frames. CPR is essentially a projection of the SMM over a year, facilitating a broader view that can capture seasonal and cyclical patterns in prepayments. This can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{CPR} = 1 - (1 - \text{SMM})^{12}
$$

This transformation to CPR aids stakeholders in forming a more comprehensive understanding of prepayment behavior, improving the robustness of prepayment risk assessments and the subsequent management of mortgage-backed securities portfolios.

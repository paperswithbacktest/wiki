signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0

# Create short simple moving average
signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()

# Create long simple moving average
signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

# Generate signals
signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   

# Generate trading orders
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

print(signals)

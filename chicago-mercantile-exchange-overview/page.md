The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, often called the CME, is a big place where people buy and sell things like farm products, money from different countries, and even promises about future prices. It started a long time ago in 1898 and is located in Chicago, Illinois. People come to the CME to trade things they need for their businesses or to make money by guessing what prices will do in the future.

The CME is very important because it helps set prices for many things around the world. For example, if you are a farmer, you can use the CME to find out how much your crops might be worth in the future. This helps farmers plan better. The CME also has a lot of computers and technology to make trading fast and easy. It's not just in Chicago anymore; it has grown to be a global marketplace where people from all over the world can trade.

Overall, the CME is a busy place where lots of different financial products are bought and sold every day.

## How does trading work at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange?

Trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, happens in two main ways: on the trading floor and through computers. On the trading floor, people called traders shout and use hand signals to buy and sell things. This is called open outcry. They trade things like farm products, money from different countries, and promises about future prices. It's a fast and exciting place where traders need to be quick and smart to make good deals.

Most trading at the CME now happens through computers. This is called electronic trading. People use special software to buy and sell things from anywhere in the world.

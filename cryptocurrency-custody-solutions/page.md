data['SMA20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['SMA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Define buy/sell signals
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][data['SMA20'] > data['SMA50']] = 1
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Buy when SMA20 crosses above SMA50
buy_signals = data[data['Position'] == 1]
# Sell when SMA20 crosses below SMA50
sell_signals = data[data['Position'] == -1]
```

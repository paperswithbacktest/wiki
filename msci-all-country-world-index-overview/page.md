```python
# Example of a simple risk management strategy using Python
import numpy as np

# Define potential market scenarios
market_scenarios = np.array([0.02, -0.01, 0.015, -0.005])  # Simulated daily returns

# Define portfolio weights aligned with MSCI ACWI
portfolio_weights = np.array([0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1])

# Calculate portfolio returns for each scenario
portfolio_returns = np.dot(market_scenarios, portfolio_weights)

# Implement a simple stop-loss strategy
def stop_loss_strategy(returns, threshold=-0.01):
    return "Sell" if returns < threshold else "Hold"

# Evaluate the strategy
decisions = [stop_loss_strategy(r) for r in portfolio_returns]
```

By addressing these challenges and considerations, traders can enhance the efficacy of their algorithmic trading strategies when aligned with the MSCI ACWI, while also managing risks more effectively in an ever-evolving global market landscape.

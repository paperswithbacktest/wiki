Some online brokers offer trading platforms with built-in automation and backtesting tools. These tools are often designed to be accessible to traders with no programming experience.

## Ask the community for help

Many online forums and communities focus on automated trading. If you have an idea for a strategy, you may find someone willing to help you formalize it or recommend a suitable platform.

## Conclusion

Even without programming skills, it's perfectly possible to automate and test a trading strategy. That said, even with the most intuitive tools, it's crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms of your strategy and to test it thoroughly before applying it in real-life conditions.

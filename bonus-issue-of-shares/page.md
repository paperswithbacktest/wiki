## What is a bonus issue of shares?

A bonus issue of shares is when a company gives its shareholders extra shares for free. It's like a reward for owning the company's stock. The company uses its profits or reserves to give these bonus shares. This means shareholders get more shares without paying anything extra.

The main reason companies do this is to make their stock more attractive to investors. When a company issues bonus shares, the price of each share goes down because there are more shares available. But the total value of what shareholders own stays the same. This can make the stock seem cheaper and more appealing to new investors.

## Why do companies issue bonus shares?

Companies issue bonus shares to make their stock more attractive to investors. When a company gives out bonus shares, it's like giving a gift to its shareholders. This can make the stock price go down because there are more shares now, but the total value of what shareholders own stays the same. This lower price can attract new investors who see the stock as a good deal.

Another reason is to show that the company is doing well. By issuing bonus shares, a company can show that it has enough profits or reserves to give something back to its shareholders. This can boost confidence in the company and make shareholders feel good about their investment. It's a way for the company to say thank you to its investors without them having to spend any more money.

## How does a bonus issue affect the stock price?

When a company issues bonus shares, it gives more shares to its shareholders for free. This means the total number of shares goes up. Because there are more shares now, the price of each share usually goes down. It's like if you have a pizza and you cut it into more slices, each slice gets smaller. So, the price per share drops, but the total value of what you own stays the same.

This drop in price can make the stock look cheaper to new investors. They might think it's a good time to buy the stock because it's at a lower price. But remember, even though the price per share is lower, the overall value of the company doesn't change. The company is just spreading its value over more shares.

## What is the difference between a bonus issue and a stock split?

A bonus issue and a stock split are two ways companies can give more shares to their shareholders, but they are different. In a bonus issue, the company uses its profits or reserves to give shareholders extra shares for free. This means the company's total value stays the same, but it's now divided into more shares. The price of each share goes down, but shareholders don't have to pay anything extra for these new shares.

On the other hand, a stock split is when a company decides to split its existing shares into more shares. For example, in a 2-for-1 stock split, each share you own turns into two shares. The total value of the company and what you own stays the same, but the price of each share goes down because there are more shares. Unlike a bonus issue, a stock split doesn't use the company's profits or reserves; it just changes the number of shares.

Both methods make the stock price go down, which can make the stock look cheaper and more attractive to new investors. But the key difference is that a bonus issue uses the company's money to give out new shares, while a stock split just changes how the existing shares are divided.

## How are bonus shares allocated to shareholders?

When a company decides to give out bonus shares, it tells shareholders how many new shares they will get for each share they already own. For example, if the company says it's a 1:2 bonus issue, that means for every two shares a shareholder has, they will get one more share for free. The company uses its profits or reserves to pay for these new shares, so shareholders don't have to pay anything extra.

The company's board of directors decides on the bonus issue and then announces it to the public. After the announcement, the company's stock price is adjusted to reflect the new total number of shares. Shareholders don't need to do anything to get their bonus shares; they are automatically added to their account on the date the company sets for the bonus issue. This makes it easy for shareholders to get their extra shares without any hassle.

## What are the tax implications of receiving bonus shares?

When you get bonus shares, you don't have to pay tax right away. This is because receiving bonus shares is not considered income. You only have to think about taxes when you decide to sell the bonus shares. If you sell them and make a profit, you might have to pay capital gains tax. The amount of tax depends on how long you held the shares and the tax laws in your country.

In many countries, if you sell the bonus shares after holding them for a long time, you might pay a lower tax rate on your profit. For example, in some places, if you hold the shares for more than a year, you might pay a lower long-term capital gains tax. But if you sell them quickly, you might pay a higher short-term capital gains tax. It's a good idea to check the tax rules in your country to understand exactly how bonus shares could affect your taxes.

## What is the process for a company to issue bonus shares?

When a company wants to issue bonus shares, the process starts with the company's board of directors. They decide that giving bonus shares is a good idea and they make a plan. This plan says how many bonus shares shareholders will get for each share they already own. For example, if it's a 1:2 bonus issue, shareholders get one new share for every two shares they have. The board then needs to get approval from the company's shareholders. They do this by holding a meeting where shareholders vote on the plan. If most shareholders agree, the plan moves forward.

Once the shareholders approve the bonus issue, the company tells the public about it. They announce the details like how many shares will be given out and when. The company uses its profits or reserves to pay for these new shares, so shareholders don't have to pay anything extra. On the date set for the bonus issue, the company's stock price is adjusted to reflect the new total number of shares. The bonus shares are then automatically added to each shareholder's account. This makes it easy for shareholders to get their extra shares without any hassle.

## How does a bonus issue impact a company's financial statements?

When a company issues bonus shares, it doesn't change the total value of the company, but it does change how the company's money is shown on its financial statements. The company uses its profits or reserves to give out these new shares. So, the amount of money in the company's reserves goes down by the value of the bonus shares. This means the company's equity stays the same, but the part called "reserves" gets smaller, and the part called "share capital" gets bigger. Share capital is the money the company gets from selling shares, and it goes up because there are more shares now.

The bonus issue also changes the company's earnings per share (EPS). EPS is how much profit the company makes for each share. When the company gives out more shares, the total number of shares goes up, so the EPS goes down. This is because the same amount of profit is now spread over more shares. But the total profit of the company doesn't change, just how it's divided among the shares. So, while the EPS goes down, the overall financial health of the company stays the same.

## What are the regulatory requirements for issuing bonus shares?

When a company wants to issue bonus shares, it has to follow certain rules set by the government or stock market regulators. The company must first get approval from its board of directors. Then, they need to hold a meeting where shareholders vote on the bonus issue. If most shareholders agree, the company can move forward with the plan. The company also needs to make sure it has enough profits or reserves to cover the cost of the new shares. This means they must check their financial statements to make sure they can afford to give out the bonus shares without hurting the company's finances.

After getting the necessary approvals, the company must follow strict rules about telling the public about the bonus issue. They have to announce the details, like how many bonus shares will be given out and the date they will be added to shareholders' accounts. This information must be shared in a clear and honest way to make sure everyone understands what's happening. The company also has to report the bonus issue to the stock exchange where its shares are traded, and follow any other rules set by the regulators to make sure everything is done fairly and legally.

## How can investors benefit from bonus issues?

Investors can benefit from bonus issues because they get more shares for free. This means they own a bigger piece of the company without spending any extra money. When a company gives out bonus shares, the price of each share goes down because there are more shares now. This can make the stock look cheaper and more attractive to new investors. If the stock price goes up later, investors can sell their bonus shares for a profit. This is a good way for investors to increase their investment without any extra cost.

Another way investors can benefit is by showing that the company is doing well. When a company decides to issue bonus shares, it usually means they have enough profits or reserves to give something back to shareholders. This can make investors feel more confident about the company's future. Plus, getting bonus shares can help investors spread out their risk. If they own more shares, they can sell some if they need money but still keep some in the company. So, bonus issues can be a win-win for investors, giving them more shares and showing that the company is strong.

## What are the potential risks associated with bonus issues for investors?

When a company gives out bonus shares, the price of each share goes down because there are more shares now. This might make some investors think the stock is worth less, even though the total value of the company stays the same. If the stock price drops a lot right after the bonus issue, investors might get worried and sell their shares. This can lead to a bigger drop in the stock price, which is not good for investors who keep their shares.

Another risk is that a bonus issue might make investors think the company is doing better than it really is. If the company's profits or reserves are not strong, using them to give out bonus shares might not be a smart move. This can make the company's finances weaker in the long run. If the company's financial health gets worse, the stock price could go down, and investors could lose money. So, it's important for investors to look at the company's overall financial situation before getting too excited about bonus shares.

## How do bonus issues affect a company's market capitalization and earnings per share?

When a company issues bonus shares, its market capitalization, or the total value of all its shares, stays the same. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the number of shares by the price of each share. Even though the number of shares goes up with a bonus issue, the price of each share goes down by the same amount. So, the total value, or market cap, doesn't change. This means that the overall worth of the company in the market remains the same, even though shareholders now own more shares.

However, a bonus issue does change the company's earnings per share (EPS). EPS is the amount of profit the company makes for each share. When the company gives out more shares, the total number of shares goes up, but the total profit stays the same. So, the EPS goes down because the same amount of profit is now spread over more shares. This doesn't mean the company is making less money; it just means the profit is divided into smaller pieces. Investors need to understand this when looking at the company's financial health after a bonus issue.

## What is Stock Issuance in Corporate Finance?

Stock issuance is a central mechanism in corporate finance through which companies raise capital by offering new shares to investors. This process plays a pivotal role in enabling a company to finance operational expansion, support project funding, and reduce existing debt. The issuance of stock is not merely a financial exercise but a strategic move to realign the company's capital structure and enhance its market presence.

Companies typically issue two primary forms of stock: common stocks and preferred stocks. Each type offers different benefits and rights to investors, and their issuance can have varying impacts on corporate finance.

### Common Stocks

Common stocks are the most prevalent form of equity a company issues. Holders of common stock enjoy voting rights, usually one vote per share, allowing them to influence major corporate decisions. These decisions can range from electing board members to approving mergers or acquisitions. In addition to voting rights, common stockholders can receive dividends—though they are not guaranteed—as these dividends are usually paid out from the company's profits after all obligations are settled.

In the event of liquidation, common stockholders are at the bottom of the priority ladder for asset distribution. They receive payments only after all creditors, including bondholders and preferred shareholders, have been compensated. The priority hierarchy in asset distribution is represented as:

$$
\text{Creditors} \rightarrow \text{Bondholders} \rightarrow \text{Preferred Stockholders} \rightarrow \text{Common Stockholders}
$$

Despite their lower priority, common stocks generally offer potential for higher returns through capital appreciation.

### Preferred Stocks

Preferred stocks represent a class of ownership with preferential treatment over common stocks in several aspects. Primarily, they provide fixed dividends, which are typically paid out before any dividends are declared for common stockholders. This fixed-income feature makes preferred stocks similar to debt instruments like bonds, offering a predictable income stream.

Preferred stockholders also have priority over common stockholders when it comes to asset distribution upon liquidation, as depicted in the distribution hierarchy above. However, unlike common stocks, preferred stocks usually do not come with voting rights, which might limit investors’ influence over company decisions.

The issuance of preferred stocks is particularly attractive to companies that wish to raise capital without diluting the voting power of existing common stockholders. Furthermore, preferred stocks can provide companies with greater flexibility in capital structure management, as they often have features like conversion options or redemption rights.

In conclusion, stock issuance is not only a tool for capital acquisition but also a strategic decision that shapes a company's financial and operational landscape. The decision to issue common or preferred stocks depends on the company's financial strategy, investor expectations, and market conditions.

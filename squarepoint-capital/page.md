## History and Formation

Squarepoint Capital's journey began within the proprietary trading unit nQuant at Lehman Brothers. This unit was known for its strong quantitative strategies and innovative approaches to trading. The pivotal moment in Squarepoint's history came in 2014 when nQuant was spun off from Barclays, a consequence of significant regulatory shifts in the financial industry. This transition led to the birth of Squarepoint Capital and was particularly influenced by the introduction of the Volcker Rule, which imposed restrictions on proprietary trading by banks.

The transformation into Squarepoint Capital was spearheaded by key figures such as Olivier Durantel and Gregoire Schneider. Their leadership was crucial in navigating the complexities of establishing an independent presence in the financial markets. This independence allowed Squarepoint to fully leverage its algorithmic prowess without the constraints that often accompany being part of a larger banking institution. The foundation laid by Durantel and Schneider set Squarepoint on a path to becoming a prominent player in quantitative finance, focused on using data-driven strategies to manage investments globally.

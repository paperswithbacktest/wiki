## What was the New Deal?

The New Deal was a series of programs and projects started by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s. It was meant to help the United States recover from the Great Depression, a time when many people were out of work and struggling. The New Deal included things like building roads and dams, helping farmers, and creating jobs for people who needed them. It also set up new rules for banks and businesses to make them safer and more fair.

One important part of the New Deal was the Social Security Act. This program gave money to older people who could not work anymore, and it helped people who were sick or out of work. Another big part was the Works Progress Administration, which paid people to build things like schools and parks. The New Deal changed the way the government helped people and made life better for many Americans during a tough time.

## What were the criticisms and controversies surrounding the New Deal?

Some people did not like the New Deal and thought it had problems. One big criticism was that it cost too much money. The government spent a lot on the New Deal programs, and some people worried that this would make the country's debt too big.

They believed that the economy should fix itself without so much help from the government.

There were also controversies about some of the New Deal programs. For example, the National Recovery Administration (NRA) tried to set rules for wages and prices, but it was later found to be against the law by the Supreme Court. Some people thought that the New Deal gave too much power to the government and took away people's freedom to make their own choices. Others felt that the New Deal did not help everyone equally and that some groups, like African Americans, did not get as much help as they needed.

## How did the New Deal influence subsequent U.S. economic policies?

The New Deal had a big impact on how the U.S. government handled the economy after the 1930s. It showed that the government could help people during tough times by creating jobs and setting up programs like Social Security. This idea of the government stepping in to help the economy became more common. Later, when the country faced other economic problems, leaders remembered the New Deal and used similar ideas. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, the government created programs to help people and businesses, much like the New Deal did.

The New Deal also changed how the government thought about helping people. It made it normal for the government to have programs that support people who are out of work or need help. This led to more laws and programs over the years that tried to make life better for Americans. The idea of a safety net, like Social Security, became a big part of U.S. policy. So, the New Deal not only helped during the Great Depression but also shaped how the government works to help people and the economy in the future.

## What were the long-term effects of the New Deal on American politics?

The New Deal changed American politics in a big way. It made people think differently about what the government should do. Before the New Deal, many people believed that the government should not get too involved in helping people or fixing the economy. But the New Deal showed that the government could create jobs and help people during tough times. This idea became more popular, and it led to more government programs to help people. It also made people see the government as something that could make their lives better, not just something that made rules.

The New Deal also changed how political parties worked. It helped the Democratic Party become stronger because President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who started the New Deal, was a Democrat. Many people liked the New Deal and voted for Democrats because they wanted the government to keep helping people. This made the Democrats more popular for a long time. Also, the New Deal started debates about how much the government should help people and the economy. These debates are still going on today, with different political groups having different ideas about the role of the government.

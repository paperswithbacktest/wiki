import numpy as np

# Example data
demand = np.array([[10], [15], [40], [20], [25]])
time = np.array([[5], [7], [15], [8], [10]])

# Train model
model = LinearRegression().fit(time, demand)

# Predict future demand
predicted_demand = model.predict(np.array([[12]]))
```

Real-time data processing further enhances these capabilities by allowing logistics companies to adapt swiftly to changing conditions on the ground.

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    queue = [(0, start)]
    distances = {start: 0}
    while queue:
        current_distance, current_vertex = heapq.heappop(queue)
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_vertex]:
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if neighbor not in distances or distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))
    return distances
```

In conclusion, algorithms are invaluable in the logistics sector, providing advanced techniques for demand forecasting and adaptable delivery solutions.

data = {'demand': [100, 150, 200], 'order_cost': [50, 75, 100], 'holding_cost': [2, 3, 4]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

def total_cost(order_qty, demand, order_cost, holding_cost):
    order_qty = max(order_qty, 1)  # Avoid division by zero
    return order_cost * (demand / order_qty) + holding_cost * (order_qty / 2)

optimal_quantities = []
for i in df.index:
    res = minimize(total_cost, x0=[10], args=(df['demand'][i], df['order_cost'][i], df['holding_cost'][i]))
    optimal_quantities.append(res.x[0])

df['optimal_order_qty'] = optimal_quantities
print(df)
```

This code snippet provides a basic framework for utilizing optimization techniques to determine optimal order quantities in a logistics context.

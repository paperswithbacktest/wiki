## What is a shareholder?

A shareholder is someone who owns shares in a company. When you buy shares, you become part-owner of that company. The more shares you have, the bigger your ownership is. Shareholders can be individuals or other companies. They often get to vote on important company decisions, like who should be on the board of directors.

Shareholders also have a chance to make money from their shares. If the company does well, the value of the shares can go up, and shareholders can sell their shares for more than they paid. Sometimes, companies also pay dividends, which are like little rewards for owning shares. These dividends are paid out regularly, usually from the company's profits. However, if the company does poorly, the value of the shares can go down, and shareholders might lose money.

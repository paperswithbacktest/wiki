## Understanding Bulk Shipping

Bulk shipping is a critical component of global trade, involving the transport of substantial quantities of unpackaged goods such as grains, coal, and iron ore. This sector is divided into two main categories: dry bulk and wet bulk shipping. Dry bulk shipping specifically deals with solid raw materials like iron ore, coal, grains, and other similar commodities, while wet bulk focuses on liquid cargoes, including crude oil and chemicals.

### Types of Vessels Used

Bulk carriers, or bulker ships, are the primary vessels used for transporting dry bulk commodities. These ships come in various sizes, ranging from small feeders to large Capesize vessels. The classification is generally based on their deadweight tonnage (DWT), which dictates the [volume](/wiki/volume-trading-strategy) of goods they can transport:

- **Handysize**: Ships with a capacity of 10,000 to 35,000 DWT, ideal for minor bulk trades.
- **Supramax**: With a capacity range of 50,000 to 60,000 DWT, suitable for a wide array of dry bulk trades.
- **Panamax**: Designed to fit through the Panama Canal, these vessels have a capacity of 60,000 to 80,000 DWT.
- **Capesize**: Large ships over 150,000 DWT, primarily used for the transportation of coal and iron ore.

The choice of vessel depends on factors such as port infrastructure, trade routes, cargo characteristics, and economic considerations.

### Significance of the Baltic Dry Index (BDI)

Developed in 1985 by the London-based Baltic Exchange, the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) serves as a leading economic indicator reflecting the demand for shipping capacity versus the supply of dry bulk carriers. It encompasses three sub-indices, which measure different sizes of bulk carriers (Capesize, Panamax, and Supramax). A high BDI indicates strong demand for shipping, often correlating with economic growth, while a decrease suggests a downturn.

Mathematically, the BDI is computed as an average of the sub-indices, weighted by ship size and market activity. It provides a composite figure representing freight costs for transporting raw materials. Fluctuations in the BDI can impact shipping rates, influencing decisions on fleet deployment and chartering strategies.

### Impact on Global Supply Chains and Economic Activities

import pandas as pd
from trading_platform import execute_trade

# Load historical market data
market_data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Define trading strategy
def trading_strategy(market_data):
    signals = []
    for i in range(1, len(market_data)):
        # Simple moving average strategy
        if market_data['price'][i] > np.mean(market_data['price'][:i]):
            signals.append('buy')
        else:
            signals.append('sell')
    return signals

# Execute trades based on strategy
trade_signals = trading_strategy(market_data)
execute_trade(trade_signals)
```

This code provides a simplified framework for implementing a trading strategy that uses past price data to inform buy and sell decisions.

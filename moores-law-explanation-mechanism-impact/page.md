This approach capitalizes significantly on computational advances, delivering unparalleled speed and efficiency in processing and executing trade orders.

The rapid adoption and growth of [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) are closely linked to Moore's Law, which forecasts the exponential increase in computational power due to the consistent doubling of transistors in integrated circuits approximately every two years. This prediction has driven advancements in processing power, enabling sophisticated algorithms that can analyze vast datasets, detect trading patterns, and execute trades within milliseconds.

A prominent subset of algorithmic trading is high-frequency trading ([HFT](/wiki/high-frequency-trading-strategies)). HFT utilizes swift data processing capabilities to achieve minor price differentials in a fraction of a second. The success of HFT largely depends on state-of-the-art processors and network infrastructures that minimize latency, ensuring that trades occur at the most profitable moments. For instance, consider a trading algorithm that analyzes stock price movements in real-time. With the following Python pseudocode, a basic structure of such an algorithm may look like this:

```python
import numpy as np

def moving_average(prices, window_size):
    return np.convolve(prices, np.ones(window_size), 'valid') / window_size

def execute_trade(signal):
    if signal == 'buy':
        print("Executing Buy Order")
    elif signal == 'sell':
        print("Executing Sell Order")

prices = [100, 102, 105, 107, 110, 108, 107]
short_window = 3
long_window = 5

short_ma = moving_average(prices, short_window)[-1]
long_ma = moving_average(prices, long_window)[-1]

if short_ma > long_ma:
    execute_trade('buy')
else:
    execute_trade('sell')
```
This simple moving average crossover strategy exemplifies a fundamental algorithmic approach to trading decisions. In practice, algorithms are far more sophisticated, integrating [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning) models and [artificial intelligence](/wiki/ai-artificial-intelligence) to refine trading strategies continuously.

Collectively, algorithmic and high-frequency trading reduce transaction costs, improve market [liquidity](/wiki/liquidity-risk-premium), and facilitate capital allocation.

A simple example of a trading algorithm written in Python might involve using historical data to identify certain market patterns for executing buy or sell orders.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Example process of identifying simple moving average crossover strategies
def SMA_strategy(data, short_window=40, long_window=100):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['price'] = data['Close']
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0) 
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Assuming 'data' is a DataFrame with a 'Close' column containing price data
signals = SMA_strategy(data)
```

This integration of financial capital with algorithmic trading not only modernizes investment strategies but also revolutionizes the financial sector by improving the speed and accuracy of trades.

## What Is BATS Global Markets?

BATS Global Markets was founded in 2005 as a U.S.-based stock exchange operator, originally known as the Better Alternative Trading System. The establishment of BATS was driven by the need to offer a competitive alternative to the then-dominant New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ. It was designed to provide an efficient and innovative trading platform, aimed at optimizing trading costs and improving the execution of trades.

BATS carved out its position in the financial sector by listing a diverse array of investment products, such as equities, options, and foreign exchange, offering traders and investors a wide range of trading opportunities. This approach allowed BATS to not only attract a substantial trading volume but also to grow its influence and reach within the industry. As a result, BATS quickly became one of the largest stock exchanges worldwide, standing out for its technological infrastructure and market structure.

The trajectory of BATS changed significantly in 2017 when it was acquired by Cboe Global Markets, a strategic move that marked its integration into one of the largest exchange-operating entities globally. This acquisition by Cboe, valued at approximately $3.2 billion, was aimed at leveraging BATS' advanced technology and robust market operations to enhance Cboe’s market offerings, particularly in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and foreign exchange products. The acquisition underscored the evolving nature of stock exchanges, where technological advancements and market consolidation are critical to maintaining competitive advantage.

## BATS: Evolution and Expansion

BATS Global Markets, originally founded in 2005, rapidly scaled its operations to become a dominant force in both the United States and European stock markets.

In the U.S., BATS made headway through its BZX and BYX exchanges, which quickly became integral components of its operational framework. These exchanges collectively managed to capture a significant share of U.S. equity trading, challenging traditional market players like NYSE and NASDAQ with their robust technological infrastructures and competitive pricing models. The scalability and efficiency of these platforms were instrumental in establishing BATS as a leading contender in the U.S. market.

The European expansion was a crucial milestone for BATS, marked by the strategic acquisition of Chi-X Europe in 2011. This acquisition not only bolstered BATS' presence in Europe but also resulted in the formation of the largest pan-European stock exchange at the time. The decision to integrate Chi-X Europe's advanced trading technology and networks played a substantial role in solidifying BATS' reputation as a formidable alternative trading platform.

By 2016, BATS had positioned itself as a key player in global financial markets, leveraging its technological advancements and strategic acquisitions to expand its reach beyond geographical boundaries. This period of aggressive expansion and strategic positioning underscored BATS’ growth trajectory, proving its capability to compete with established global exchanges on both technological and operational fronts.

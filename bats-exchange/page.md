## What is BATS Exchange?

BATS Exchange is a stock market that lets people buy and sell stocks and other financial products. It started in 2005 and is now one of the biggest stock exchanges in the United States. BATS stands for "Better Alternative Trading System." The exchange was created to give traders another place to trade stocks, which could help lower the costs of trading.

In 2016, BATS Exchange was bought by Cboe Global Markets, which is another big company that runs financial markets. Now, it's called Cboe BZX Exchange and Cboe BYX Exchange. These exchanges still help people trade stocks and other things like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They are important because they help make sure that trading is fair and that there are lots of choices for where to trade.

## Who founded BATS Exchange and when was it established?

BATS Exchange was founded by Dave Cummings and Bill O'Brien. They started it in June 2005. Dave and Bill wanted to create a new place for people to trade stocks because they thought it could be done better and cheaper than at the big exchanges.

At first, BATS was just a small company trying to make trading easier and less expensive. Over time, it grew a lot and became one of the biggest stock exchanges in the U.S. It helped change how stock trading works by giving people more choices and often lower costs.

## What types of financial instruments are traded on BATS Exchange?

BATS Exchange, now known as Cboe BZX Exchange and Cboe BYX Exchange, trades many different types of financial instruments. The main things people trade there are stocks, which are shares in companies. People buy and sell these stocks to try to make money as the value of the companies goes up or down. BATS also lets people trade exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are like baskets of stocks or other assets that you can buy and sell like a single stock.

Besides stocks and ETFs, BATS Exchange also handles trading in options. Options are contracts that give you the right to buy or sell a stock at a certain price before a certain date. This can be a way for people to bet on what they think will happen to a stock's price without actually buying the stock itself. All these different financial instruments help make BATS a busy place where lots of trading happens every day.

## How does BATS Exchange differ from other stock exchanges?

BATS Exchange, now known as Cboe BZX Exchange and Cboe BYX Exchange, is different from other stock exchanges in a few ways. One big difference is that BATS started as a way to make trading cheaper and easier. They wanted to be a "Better Alternative Trading System," which is what BATS stands for. This means they tried to have lower fees and better technology to make trading faster and less expensive for people. Because of this, many traders and big investors liked using BATS because it saved them money.

Another way BATS Exchange is different is that it was one of the first exchanges to focus a lot on electronic trading. This means that instead of people shouting and waving their hands on a trading floor, everything happens on computers. This made trading faster and more efficient. BATS also became known for trading a lot of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are like baskets of stocks you can buy and sell. This focus on ETFs and electronic trading helped BATS grow quickly and become a big part of the stock market.

## What are the trading hours for BATS Exchange?

The BATS Exchange, now known as Cboe BZX Exchange and Cboe BYX Exchange, has regular trading hours from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time, just like most other big stock exchanges in the U.S. This is when most people buy and sell stocks and other financial products like ETFs and options. During these hours, the market is open and lots of trading happens.

There are also times before and after the regular trading hours when you can trade on BATS Exchange. These are called pre-market and after-hours trading.

## How can one start trading on BATS Exchange?

The trading platform is like a special computer program that lets you see prices and make trades. You can choose what you want to buy or sell, how much, and at what price. Once you place your order, the brokerage will send it to BATS Exchange to be filled.

## What are the fees associated with trading on BATS Exchange?

When you trade on BATS Exchange, which is now called Cboe BZX Exchange and Cboe BYX Exchange, you might have to pay some fees. These fees can be different depending on the brokerage firm you use. Usually, there are two main types of fees: a commission, which is what you pay the brokerage for making the trade, and a fee from the exchange itself. The exchange fee can be different if you are adding liquidity to the market by placing an order that others can buy or sell against, or if you are taking liquidity by buying or selling against someone else's order. Adding liquidity often costs less than taking liquidity.

Some brokerages might offer free trades, which means they don't charge you a commission. But even if the commission is free, you might still have to pay the exchange fee. It's a good idea to check with your brokerage to see all the fees you might have to pay. The fees can add up, so understanding them can help you save money and make better trading decisions.

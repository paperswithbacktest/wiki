A Nominated Advisor, often called a Nomad, is a special type of advisor for companies listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in the UK. The AIM is a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange designed for smaller, growing companies. A Nomad helps these companies follow the rules of the AIM and make sure they do everything correctly. They act like a guide, helping the company from the time it wants to join the AIM until it is listed and even after that.

Nomads have important jobs. They check if a company is good enough to be on the AIM and help it get ready for the listing process. After the company is listed, the Nomad keeps watching to make sure the company follows all the rules. If the company does something wrong, the Nomad helps fix it. This way, investors can trust that the companies on the AIM are being looked after properly.

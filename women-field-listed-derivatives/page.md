## What are listed derivatives and how do they function in financial markets?

Listed derivatives are financial instruments that are traded on an organized exchange, like stocks or bonds. They get their value from an underlying asset, such as a commodity, currency, stock, or market index. Common types of listed derivatives include futures and options. Futures are contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase, and the seller to sell, an asset at a set price on a future date. Options give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a set price before a certain date.

In financial markets, listed derivatives serve several important functions. They allow investors to hedge against price movements in the underlying assets, reducing their risk. For example, a farmer might use futures to lock in a price for their crops, protecting against price drops. Additionally, listed derivatives provide a way for investors to speculate on price movements without needing to own the actual asset. This can lead to increased market liquidity and efficiency, as more participants can engage in trading. Overall, listed derivatives help in managing risk and enhancing the flexibility of investment strategies.

## How have women historically been involved in the field of listed derivatives?

Women have been involved in the field of listed derivatives for many years, but their participation has grown significantly over time. In the early days, the financial markets, including the trading of derivatives, were mostly dominated by men. Women faced many barriers, like not being allowed to join trading floors or being overlooked for important roles. Despite these challenges, some women made their mark. For example, in the 1970s, women like Susan Phillips started to break into the field, working in regulatory roles and helping to shape the rules of the market.

Over the years, more and more women have entered the field of listed derivatives. They have taken on roles as traders, analysts, and executives. Today, women are found in all levels of the industry, from junior positions to top leadership roles. Organizations have also started programs to encourage more women to join and succeed in the field. While there is still work to be done to achieve full equality, the involvement of women in listed derivatives has come a long way, and their contributions are increasingly recognized and valued.

## What challenges do women face when entering and advancing in the field of listed derivatives?

Women entering the field of listed derivatives often face challenges because the industry has been mostly led by men for a long time. When women start working in this field, they might find it hard to be taken seriously or to get the same chances as men. For example, they might not be chosen for important projects or promotions as often. This can make it tough for women to show what they can do and move up in their careers.

Even when women do well in their jobs, they might still face barriers to advancing. Sometimes, the culture at work can make women feel like they don't belong or that they have to work harder to prove themselves. This can be tiring and discouraging.

## How have regulatory changes impacted women's participation in listed derivatives?

Regulatory changes have helped women get more involved in listed derivatives. In the past, rules did not always help women join the industry. But now, new rules make sure that everyone has a fair chance. For example, laws about equal pay and against discrimination help women get jobs and move up in their careers. These rules make companies think more about hiring and promoting women, which means more women can work in listed derivatives.

Also, rules that make trading more open and clear have helped women. When trading is more transparent, it is easier for everyone to understand and join in. This can make it easier for women to learn about derivatives and start working in the field. Overall, these regulatory changes have made the industry more welcoming to women, giving them more opportunities to succeed in listed derivatives.

## Can you explain the benefits of investing in REITs as per NAREIT?

Investing in REITs can be a good idea because they let you own a piece of big real estate projects without having to buy the whole building yourself. REITs own and manage different kinds of properties like apartments, shopping centers, and offices. When you invest in a REIT, you get to share in the money they make from renting these properties out. This can give you a steady income, kind of like getting rent money without being a landlord yourself.

Another benefit of investing in REITs is that they can help you spread out your investments. Instead of putting all your money into one thing, you can invest in a REIT that owns many different properties. This can make your investment safer because if one property doesn't do well, the others might still be doing okay. Plus, REITs have to pay out most of their income as dividends, which means you can get regular payments, which can be really helpful if you're looking for a steady income.

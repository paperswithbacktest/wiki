def moving_average_strategy(price_data, short_window=40, long_window=100):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=price_data.index)
    signals['price'] = price_data
    signals['short_mavg'] = price_data.rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    signals['long_mavg'] = price_data.rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > 
                                                 signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Example usage
# price_data = pd.Series([...])  # Insert real market data here
# signals = moving_average_strategy(price_data)
```

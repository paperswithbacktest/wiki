```python
import ftx
import pandas as pd

client = ftx.FtxClient(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY', api_secret='YOUR_API_SECRET')

def fetch_market_data(market, resolution):
    data = client.get_historical_data(market_name=market, resolution=resolution, start_time=int(pd.Timestamp.now(tz='UTC').timestamp())-3600*24)
    return pd.DataFrame(data)

market_data = fetch_market_data('BTC-PERP', 3600)
market_data['SMA_50'] = market_data['close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
market_data['SMA_200'] = market_data['close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

buy_signals = market_data[market_data['SMA_50'] > market_data['SMA_200']]
sell_signals = market_data[market_data['SMA_50'] < market_data['SMA_200']]

# Implement buy and sell logic based on buy_signals and sell_signals
```

By executing trades programmatically, traders can react to market changes faster and reduce the emotional biases that often affect manual trading decisions.

### Case Study 2: Arbitrage Strategies Across Multiple Exchanges

Arbitrage involves exploiting price differences of the same asset across different markets or exchanges. The FTX API enables traders to swiftly execute arbitrage strategies due to its efficient execution capabilities.

For instance, a simple arbitrage strategy could involve detecting a price discrepancy for Bitcoin between FTX and another exchange, then buying low on one platform and selling high on the other. This can be implemented using the FTX API to monitor price feeds and automate trade execution when opportunities arise.

```python
from time import sleep
import requests

def get_price(exchange_api, market):
    if exchange_api == 'ftx':
        return client.get_market(market)['price']
    else:
        response = requests.get(f'https://api.otherexchange.com/markets/{market}')
        return response.json()['price']

while True:
    ftx_price = get_price('ftx', 'BTC-PERP')
    other_price = get_price('other', 'BTC-USD')

    if ftx_price < other_price - 100:  # Arbitrage threshold
        client.place_order(market='BTC-PERP', side='buy', price=ftx_price, size=1)
        client.place_order(market='BTC-USD', side='sell', price=other_price, size=1)
    
    sleep(60)  # Slow down the loop to avoid hitting API rate limits.
```

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample data: delivery volumes and corresponding stock prices
delivery_volumes = np.array([100, 200, 300, 400, 500]).reshape(-1, 1)
stock_prices = np.array([10, 20, 25, 35, 50])

# Initialize the Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(delivery_volumes, stock_prices)

# Predict stock price for a new delivery volume
predicted_price = model.predict(np.array([[600]]))
print(f"Predicted stock price for delivery volume of 600: {predicted_price[0]}")
```

This simple model demonstrates how delivery volumes can be used to predict stock prices, offering traders an additional tool in their decision-making arsenal.

The integration of food service data into trading strategies offers promising avenues for financial growth and risk management.

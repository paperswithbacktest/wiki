## What is the Singapore Exchange (SGX)?

The Singapore Exchange, or SGX, is a place where people can buy and sell stocks, bonds, and other financial products. It is like a big marketplace where companies can list their shares for investors to trade. The SGX is important because it helps companies raise money and grow their business by selling parts of their company to the public.

The SGX was started in 1999 when two older exchanges in Singapore joined together. Today, it is one of the main financial centers in Asia. People from all over the world use the SGX to invest in companies and other financial products. The exchange makes sure that trading is fair and follows the rules, so everyone can trust the market.

## When was the Singapore Exchange established?

The Singapore Exchange, or SGX, was established in 1999. Before that, there were two separate exchanges in Singapore. These two exchanges came together to form the SGX.

The SGX is important because it helps companies raise money by selling shares to the public. It is a big marketplace where people can buy and sell stocks, bonds, and other financial products. People from all over the world use the SGX to invest in companies and other financial products.

## What types of financial instruments are traded on the SGX?

The Singapore Exchange, or SGX, is a place where many different types of financial instruments are traded. The main ones are stocks, which are shares in companies. When you buy a stock, you own a small part of that company. People also trade bonds on the SGX. Bonds are like loans that investors give to companies or governments, and in return, they get interest payments over time.

Besides stocks and bonds, the SGX also has trading in derivatives. Derivatives are financial products whose value depends on something else, like the price of a stock or a commodity. Examples include futures and options. Futures are agreements to buy or sell something at a future date for a set price, while options give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell at a set price. 

There are also exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs) on the SGX. ETFs are baskets of securities that track an index, like the Straits Times Index, and can be bought and sold like stocks. REITs are companies that own and operate income-generating real estate, and investors can buy shares in them to earn dividends from the rental income.

## How does one start trading on the SGX?

To start trading on the Singapore Exchange, or SGX, you first need to open a trading account with a brokerage firm. A brokerage firm is a company that helps you buy and sell stocks and other financial products. You can choose from many different brokerage firms, so it's a good idea to compare them and see which one offers the services and fees that work best for you. Once you've picked a brokerage firm, you'll need to fill out an application form and provide some personal information, like your ID and proof of address. After your account is approved, you can deposit money into it to start trading.

Once your trading account is set up and funded, you can start buying and selling on the SGX. You can do this through the brokerage firm's trading platform, which is usually a website or an app. On the platform, you can search for the stocks, bonds, or other financial products you want to trade. You'll need to decide how many shares you want to buy or sell and at what price. After you place your order, the brokerage firm will execute it on the SGX. It's important to keep learning about the market and the companies you're interested in, so you can make smart trading decisions.

## What are the operating hours of the SGX?

The Singapore Exchange, or SGX, has different trading times for different types of financial products. For stocks and bonds, the market is open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Singapore time, from Monday to Friday. This is when most people can buy and sell shares in companies and other securities.

For derivatives, like futures and options, the trading hours are a bit different. The SGX has two sessions for derivatives trading. The first session is from 8:30 AM to 5:15 PM, and the second session is from 5:30 PM to 4:15 AM the next day. This means that you can trade derivatives almost around the clock, except for a short break in the afternoon and early morning.

It's important to know these times so you can plan when to trade. The SGX is closed on weekends and public holidays, so you can't trade on those days.

If a company breaks the rules, the SGX can punish them, like by fining them or even stopping them from trading.

The SGX also uses technology to keep an eye on the market. They have systems that watch for strange trading patterns or big price changes that might mean something is wrong. If they see something that looks fishy, they can investigate it and take action to fix it. This helps keep the market safe and trustworthy for everyone.

The SGX has a wide range of financial products like stocks, bonds, and derivatives, which makes it attractive to many investors. It's known for being a well-regulated market, which means it has strict rules to make sure trading is fair and safe.

Compared to the NYSE and NASDAQ, the SGX has different trading hours that can be good for investors who want to trade outside of the usual U.S. market times. The NYSE and NASDAQ are much bigger and have more companies listed, which can offer more choices for investors.

However, the SGX is still a key player in the global market, especially for investors interested in the Asian region, and it works hard to keep its market safe and trustworthy with advanced technology and strict rules.

## What is the Over-The-Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI)?

The Over-The-Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI) is a stock exchange in India that was set up to help small and medium-sized companies trade their shares easily. It started in 1992 and works differently from bigger stock exchanges like the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) or the National Stock Exchange (NSE). OTCEI allows companies that might not meet the strict rules of larger exchanges to still raise money by selling their shares to the public.

OTCEI uses a system where dealers, who are like middlemen, help in buying and selling shares. This makes it easier for investors to trade because they can do it through these dealers instead of directly on a big exchange. The main goal of OTCEI is to make it simpler and less costly for smaller companies to get listed and for investors to buy and sell their shares.

## How does OTCEI differ from traditional stock exchanges?

OTCEI is different from traditional stock exchanges like the BSE or NSE because it focuses on helping smaller companies. Traditional exchanges have strict rules that can be hard for small businesses to follow. OTCEI has easier rules so more companies can list their shares and raise money. This makes it easier for small and medium-sized companies to grow.

Another big difference is how trading happens. On traditional exchanges, you buy and sell shares directly on the exchange. But on OTCEI, dealers help with the trading. These dealers act like middlemen, making it simpler for investors to buy and sell shares. This system can be less confusing and more helpful for people who are new to investing or for companies that are just starting out.

## What are the main features of OTCEI?

OTCEI is a special stock exchange in India that helps small and medium-sized companies. It was made to make it easier for these companies to sell their shares to the public and raise money. Unlike big exchanges like the BSE or NSE, OTCEI has simpler rules. This means more companies can list their shares on OTCEI without having to meet tough requirements. This helps small businesses grow and get the money they need.

Another important feature of OTCEI is how it handles trading. Instead of buying and selling shares directly on the exchange like you do on traditional exchanges, OTCEI uses dealers. These dealers act as middlemen and help investors buy and sell shares. This makes trading easier and less confusing, especially for new investors or smaller companies. The goal is to make the whole process of investing and raising money simpler and more accessible for everyone involved.

## What are the eligibility criteria for companies to list on OTCEI?

To list on OTCEI, a company needs to meet some basic rules. First, the company must have been making profits for at least two out of the last three years. This shows that the company is doing well and can be trusted by investors. Also, the company should have a minimum paid-up capital of Rs. 30 lakhs. This means the company should have enough money invested in it to start with.

Another important rule is about the number of shares the company needs to offer to the public. The company must offer at least 25% of its shares to the public. This helps make sure there are enough shares for people to buy and trade. The company also needs to have at least 1,000 shareholders after the offer. This shows that many people believe in the company and want to invest in it.

Lastly, the company needs to follow some rules about how it runs its business. It must have a good management team and clear financial reports. OTCEI wants to make sure that companies are honest and well-managed so that investors feel safe putting their money into them. These rules are simpler than those of bigger exchanges, making it easier for smaller companies to list on OTCEI.

## How does the listing process work on OTCEI?

The listing process on OTCEI is made to be simple for small and medium-sized companies. To start, a company needs to apply to OTCEI and show that it meets the basic rules. This includes having made profits for at least two out of the last three years, having a minimum paid-up capital of Rs. 30 lakhs, and being ready to offer at least 25% of its shares to the public. Once the company submits its application, OTCEI checks all the documents and information to make sure everything is correct.

If OTCEI approves the application, the company moves to the next step, which is the public offering. During this time, the company offers its shares to the public. The goal is to get at least 1,000 shareholders after the offer. The company also needs to make sure its business is run well, with a good management team and clear financial reports. Once the public offering is successful and all rules are followed, the company's shares can start trading on OTCEI, helping the company raise money and grow.

## What are the trading mechanisms used on OTCEI?

Another way OTCEI protects investors is by making sure companies follow rules about how they run their business. Companies need to have a good management team and clear financial reports. This helps investors understand how the company is doing and makes it easier to trust them with their money. OTCEI also keeps an eye on trading to stop any bad behavior, like cheating or lying about share prices. By doing all these things, OTCEI helps make sure that trading is honest and safe for everyone involved.

## What are Betterment and Fidelity Go?

Betterment and Fidelity Go are both robo-advisors, which are online platforms that use computer algorithms to manage your investments. Betterment was one of the first robo-advisors and it helps you invest your money in a way that matches your goals and how much risk you want to take. You can start investing with a small amount of money, and Betterment will automatically adjust your investments to keep them balanced.

Fidelity Go is another robo-advisor, but it is offered by Fidelity, a big financial company. Like Betterment, Fidelity Go uses technology to manage your investments based on your goals and risk level. One difference is that Fidelity Go is free if you have less than a certain amount of money invested, but you need to have a Fidelity account to use it. Both services make it easy for people to invest without needing to know a lot about the stock market.

## How do the fee structures of Betterment and Fidelity Go compare?

Betterment has two different plans. The first plan is called the Digital plan, and it costs 0.25% of the money you have invested each year. This means if you have $10,000 invested, you will pay $25 a year. The second plan is called the Premium plan, and it costs 0.40% of your money each year. This plan is for people who have at least $100,000 to invest and want extra help from financial experts.

Fidelity Go, on the other hand, is free if you have less than $25,000 invested. If you have more than $25,000, you will pay 0.35% of your money each year.

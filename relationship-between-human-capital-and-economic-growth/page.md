short_window = 40
long_window = 100

# Calculate short and long moving averages
short_ma = df['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
long_ma = df['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

# Identify signals
df['Signal'] = 0
df['Signal'][short_window:] = np.where(short_ma[short_window:] > long_ma[short_window:], 1, 0)

# Generate trading orders
df['Position'] = df['Signal'].diff()
```

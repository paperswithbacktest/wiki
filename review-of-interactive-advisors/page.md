## What are Interactive Advisors?

Interactive Advisors is a company that helps people invest their money. They offer different types of investment accounts, like individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and regular investment accounts. People can choose from many different investment options, like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The company uses technology to make investing easier and more accessible for everyone.

One special thing about Interactive Advisors is that they use a method called robo-advising. This means they use computer programs to help manage your investments. These programs look at your goals and how much risk you want to take, and then they create a plan for your money. This can be a good option for people who don't want to spend a lot of time managing their investments themselves.

## How do Interactive Advisors work?

Interactive Advisors helps people invest their money by using a computer program called a robo-advisor. When you start with Interactive Advisors, you tell them about your financial goals and how much risk you're okay with. The robo-advisor then makes an investment plan just for you. It picks different investments like stocks and bonds and puts your money into them. This way, you don't have to pick the investments yourself.

After your money is invested, the robo-advisor keeps an eye on it. If the market changes or if your goals change, the robo-advisor can adjust your investments to keep you on track. You can check your account anytime online to see how your money is doing. This makes investing easier because the computer does a lot of the work for you.

## What types of investment options do Interactive Advisors offer?

Interactive Advisors offers different types of investment options to help people reach their financial goals. They have investment accounts like individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and regular investment accounts. You can choose from a variety of investments, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. This variety helps you build a portfolio that matches what you want and how much risk you're willing to take.

The company uses a robo-advisor to manage these investments. The robo-advisor looks at your goals and risk level, then picks the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments for you. This way, you don't have to spend a lot of time figuring out where to put your money. The robo-advisor keeps an eye on your investments and makes changes if needed, so your money stays on track to meet your goals.

## How does the fee structure of Interactive Advisors compare to other robo-advisors?

Interactive Advisors charges a fee for managing your investments. Their fee is around 0.08% to 0.25% of the money you have invested each year. This means if you have $10,000 invested, you might pay between $8 and $25 a year. Compared to other robo-advisors, Interactive Advisors' fees are on the lower side. Many other robo-advisors charge between 0.25% and 0.50% a year. So, Interactive Advisors can save you money on fees.

It's important to think about fees when choosing a robo-advisor because they can affect how much money you keep in the end. Even though Interactive Advisors has low fees, you should also look at what other services they offer. Some robo-advisors might charge more but give you extra help or features. Make sure to compare everything to find the best fit for you.

## What is the minimum investment required to start with Interactive Advisors?

To start investing with Interactive Advisors, you need at least $100. This is a pretty low amount compared to some other investment companies. It means that even if you don't have a lot of money to start with, you can still begin to invest and grow your savings.

Once you have your $100, you can open an account and the robo-advisor will help you pick the right investments for you. It's a good way to start investing without needing a big amount of money right away.

## How does Interactive Advisors tailor investment strategies to individual needs?

Interactive Advisors uses a robo-advisor to make an investment plan that fits your own needs. When you start, you tell them what you want to achieve with your money and how much risk you're okay with. The robo-advisor then looks at this information and picks the right mix of investments like stocks and bonds for you. This way, your money is invested in a way that matches your goals and how much you're willing to risk.

The robo-advisor doesn't just set up your investments and forget about them. It keeps watching the market and your account. If things change, like the market goes up or down, or if your goals change, the robo-advisor can change your investments to keep you on track. This means your investment plan stays up-to-date and works hard to meet your personal goals.

## What are the tax optimization features available with Interactive Advisors?

Interactive Advisors helps you save on taxes by using something called tax-loss harvesting. This means they look for chances to sell investments that have gone down in value. By selling these, you can use the losses to lower your taxes. It's like finding a silver lining in a bad investment. This feature is automatic, so you don't have to do anything extra to use it.

They also offer different types of accounts that can help you save on taxes. For example, they have individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and Roth IRAs. With these accounts, you can save money for retirement and get tax benefits. Traditional IRAs let you save on taxes now, while Roth IRAs can help you save on taxes later when you take the money out. This way, you can choose the account that fits your tax situation best.

## How does the performance of Interactive Advisors compare to its competitors?

Interactive Advisors has done well compared to other robo-advisors. They use a computer program to pick investments that match what you want and how much risk you're okay with. This has helped them get good returns for their customers. When you look at how much money people have made with Interactive Advisors, it's often as good as or better than other robo-advisors. They also keep their fees low, which means you get to keep more of your money.

One thing to think about is that past performance doesn't always tell you what will happen in the future. But, Interactive Advisors has a good track record. They've been able to keep up with or beat other robo-advisors like Betterment and Wealthfront. This is because they use smart technology and keep their costs down. So, if you're looking for a robo-advisor that has done well and charges less, Interactive Advisors is a good choice.

They also have other ways to keep your account safe. For example, they use two-factor authentication.

## Understanding the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Program

The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program is a federal initiative designed to support American workers negatively impacted by increased import competition. Its core mission is to help these workers transition to new employment opportunities through various forms of support, including job training, relocation allowances, and income support. Established under the Trade Act of 1974, the program's significance has increased as globalization has led to more industries facing job losses due to foreign competition.

Funded by the U.S. government and administered by the Department of Labor, TAA provides a comprehensive set of services. These include career counseling, skills assessment, financial aid for training, and allowances for job search and relocation. The program also offers income support for workers enrolled in full-time training, ensuring they have the necessary financial stability to focus on acquiring new skills.

Furthermore, a deep understanding of statistical methods and market behavior is crucial. Workers can leverage resources such as the Efficient Market Hypothesis and the Black-Scholes model to inform their trading decisions.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from backtesting import Backtest, Strategy

# Example of a simple moving average strategy
class SmaCross(Strategy):
    n1 = 10
    n2 = 20

    def init(self):
        # Calculate moving averages
        self.sma1 = self.data.Close.rolling(self.n1).mean()
        self.sma2 = self.data.Close.rolling(self.n2).mean()

    def next(self):
        # If short-term average crosses above long-term average, buy
        if self.sma1[-1] > self.sma2[-1]:
            self.buy()
        # If short-term average crosses below long-term average, sell
        elif self.sma1[-1] < self.sma2[-1]:
            self.sell()

# Example usage with historical data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_stock_data.csv')
bt = Backtest(data, SmaCross, cash=10_000, commission=0.002)
bt.run()
```

# Assume we have a dataframe 'data' with features and 'target' as market signals
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Model accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

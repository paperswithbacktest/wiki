# Simulating a simple mean reversion strategy
def mean_reversion(prices, threshold=0.05):
    mean_price = np.mean(prices)
    signals = []

    for price in prices:
        if (price - mean_price) / mean_price > threshold:
            signals.append('Sell')
        elif (mean_price - price) / mean_price > threshold:
            signals.append('Buy')
        else:
            signals.append('Hold')

    return signals

# Sample price data
price_data = np.array([50, 48, 51, 49, 53, 52, 50])
signals = mean_reversion(price_data)
print(signals)  # Output: ['Hold', 'Buy', 'Hold', 'Buy', 'Sell', 'Hold', 'Hold']

### Definition and Mechanics of Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic trading can be defined as the deployment of computer algorithms to make trading decisions with minimal human intervention. These algorithms use an array of data inputs including historical price data, trading volumes, and real-time market information to identify trading opportunities. They can implement complex strategies encompassing [market making](/wiki/market-making), [arbitrage](/wiki/arbitrage), [trend following](/wiki/trend-following), and [statistical arbitrage](/wiki/statistical-arbitrage) among others.

The basic mechanics involve the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Real-time data feeds are ingested to provide the algorithm with the latest market information.
2. **Signal Generation**: The algorithm processes this data to identify potential trading signals or patterns using predefined criteria.
3. **Risk Management**: Algorithms can include risk management protocols to limit potential losses and optimize returns.
4. **Execution**: Once a trading decision is made, algorithms interact with market exchanges to place orders quickly and efficiently.

Python sample code illustrating a simple moving average crossover strategy could look like this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load historical stock data
data = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')
data['SMA_10'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
data['SMA_30'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=30).mean()

# Generate trading signals
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][10:] = np.where(data['SMA_10'][10:] > data['SMA_30'][10:], 1, 0)
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Display the resulting dataframe
data.dropna(inplace=True)
print(data[['Close', 'SMA_10', 'SMA_30', 'Signal', 'Position']])
```

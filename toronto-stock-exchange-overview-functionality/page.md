# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Define buy/sell signals
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][data['SMA_50'] > data['SMA_200']] = 1  # Buy
data['Signal'][data['SMA_50'] < data['SMA_200']] = -1  # Sell

# Identify trade execution points
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Filter trades
trades = data[data['Position'] != 0]
```

Such strategies rely on computational power and require access to swift and reliable market data, both of which the TSX effectively provides.

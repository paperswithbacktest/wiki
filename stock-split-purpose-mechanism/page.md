## What is a stock split?

A stock split is when a company decides to increase the number of its shares by dividing each existing share into multiple shares. This means if you own one share before the split, you might own two or more shares after the split, depending on the ratio the company chooses. The main reason companies do this is to make their stock price lower and more affordable to smaller investors. Even though the number of shares you own increases, the total value of your investment stays the same right after the split.

For example, if a company's stock is trading at $100 per share and they do a 2-for-1 split, the price per share will drop to $50. You will then own twice as many shares, but the total value of your investment remains $100. This can make the stock seem more accessible to new investors who might be hesitant to buy a stock priced at $100 but feel more comfortable buying at $50. Stock splits don't change the overall value of the company; they just change how the company's value is divided among more shares.

## Why do companies decide to perform a stock split?

Companies decide to perform a stock split mainly to make their stock more affordable to smaller investors. When a stock's price gets very high, it can seem too expensive for some people to buy, even if they believe in the company. By splitting the stock, the price per share goes down, making it easier for more people to buy it. This can increase the demand for the stock and make it more attractive to a wider audience.

Another reason for a stock split is to increase the [liquidity](/wiki/liquidity-risk-premium) of the stock. Liquidity means how easily shares can be bought and sold without affecting the stock's price too much. When more people can afford to buy the stock, more shares are traded, which can make the market for the stock more active. This can be good for the company because it shows that there is strong interest in their stock. Overall, stock splits are a way for companies to keep their stock attractive and accessible to investors.

## How does a stock split affect the price of a stock?

When a company does a stock split, it makes the price of each share go down. For example, if a company's stock is $100 and they do a 2-for-1 split, the price will become $50 per share. This happens because the company is giving more shares to its current shareholders, so the total value of the company stays the same but it's spread over more shares.

Even though the price per share goes down right after a stock split, the total value of what you own doesn't change right away. If you had one share worth $100 before the split, after a 2-for-1 split, you'd have two shares worth $50 each, still totaling $100. Over time, the stock price might go up or down because of other things like how the company is doing or what's happening in the market, but the split itself doesn't change the total value of the company.

## What is the process of executing a stock split?

When a company decides to do a stock split, the first thing they do is announce it. They tell everyone when the split will happen and what the split ratio will be. For example, they might say they are doing a 2-for-1 split, which means every share will turn into two shares. The company needs to get approval from its board of directors before they can go ahead with the split. Once they have the approval, they set a date called the "record date." This is the date when they look at who owns the stock to figure out who gets the new shares.

On the day of the split, the company's stock price is adjusted to reflect the new number of shares. If it was a 2-for-1 split, the price per share will be half of what it was before. The company then gives the new shares to the shareholders. If you owned one share before the split, you would now own two shares. All of this happens automatically, so shareholders don't have to do anything. After the split, the total value of what you own stays the same right away, but the price per share is lower, which can make the stock more attractive to new investors.

## Can a stock split affect a company's market capitalization?

A stock split does not change a company's market capitalization right away. Market capitalization is the total value of all the company's shares. When a company does a stock split, it gives more shares to its shareholders, but the price of each share goes down by the same amount. So, if you multiply the new number of shares by the new lower price per share, you get the same total value as before the split. This means the market capitalization stays the same right after the split.

Over time, though, a stock split might affect the company's market capitalization indirectly. When the price per share goes down, more people might want to buy the stock because it seems more affordable. If more people buy the stock and the demand goes up, the price per share might go up too. If the price goes up enough, the market capitalization could increase. But this is not because of the stock split itself; it's because of how people react to the lower price and decide to buy more shares.

## What is the difference between a forward and a reverse stock split?

A forward stock split is when a company decides to increase the number of its shares. This makes the price of each share go down, so more people can afford to buy it. For example, in a 2-for-1 forward split, if you owned one share before the split, you would own two shares after, but the price per share would be half of what it was before. The total value of your investment stays the same right after the split, but the lower price can make the stock more attractive to new investors.

A reverse stock split is the opposite. It's when a company decides to decrease the number of its shares. This makes the price of each share go up. For example, in a 1-for-2 reverse split, if you owned two shares before the split, you would own one share after, but the price per share would be double what it was before. Companies often do reverse splits to make their stock price look higher, which might help them meet the minimum price requirements to stay listed on a stock exchange. Just like with a forward split, the total value of your investment stays the same right after the split.

## How do stock splits impact shareholders?

When a company does a stock split, it gives more shares to its shareholders but makes the price of each share go down. If you owned one share before the split and the company does a 2-for-1 split, you'll have two shares after, but each share will be worth less. Right after the split, the total value of what you own stays the same. So, if your one share was worth $100 before, your two new shares will each be worth $50, still totaling $100. This doesn't change the amount of money you have in the stock right away.

Over time, stock splits can affect shareholders in other ways. Because the price per share goes down, more people might want to buy the stock. If more people buy it, the demand might go up, which could make the price per share go up too. If that happens, the total value of what you own could increase. But this isn't because of the stock split itself; it's because more people are interested in the stock after the price goes down. So, while a stock split doesn't change your money right away, it can make the stock more popular and possibly more valuable later on.

## What are the psychological effects of a stock split on investors?

When a company does a stock split, it can make investors feel good. The lower price per share can make the stock seem like a better deal. People might think, "Oh, now I can buy more shares for the same amount of money!" This can make them feel like they are getting a bargain, even though the total value of the company hasn't changed. The lower price can also make the stock seem less risky, so more people might want to buy it.

But there's another side too. Some investors might worry that a stock split means the company is trying to hide something. They might think, "Why does the company need to make the stock cheaper? Is something wrong?" This can make them feel nervous or unsure about the company's future. So, while many investors feel excited by a stock split, others might feel a bit worried.

## How often do companies typically perform stock splits?

Companies don't do stock splits all the time. They usually do them when their stock price gets really high, like over $100 or even $500 per share. This can happen a few times in a company's life, but it's not something that happens every year. Some companies might never do a stock split, while others might do it a few times over many years.

When a company decides to do a stock split, it's often because they want more people to be able to buy their stock. If the price is too high, some people might not want to buy it. By making the price lower, the company hopes more people will be interested. But it's not a regular thing, so investors shouldn't expect stock splits to happen very often.

## What historical examples illustrate the impact of stock splits?

One famous example of a stock split is when Apple did a 7-for-1 split in 2014. Before the split, Apple's stock was around $645 per share. After the split, the price went down to about $92 per share. People got excited because they could now buy Apple stock for less money. More people started buying it, and the stock price went up over time. This showed how a stock split can make a company's stock more popular and help its price grow.

Another example is when Tesla did a 5-for-1 split in 2020. Before the split, Tesla's stock was about $2,213 per share. After the split, the price dropped to around $442 per share. Just like with Apple, more people wanted to buy Tesla stock because it was cheaper. This helped the stock price go up after the split. These examples show that stock splits can make a stock seem more affordable and attract more investors, which can lead to a higher stock price over time.

## How do stock splits fit into a company's broader financial strategy?

When a company decides to do a stock split, it's part of their bigger plan to make their stock more popular and easier for people to buy. If the stock price gets too high, some people might think it's too expensive, even if they like the company. By splitting the stock, the company makes the price per share go down. This can make more people want to buy it because it seems like a better deal. More buyers can help the stock price go up over time, which is good for the company.

Stock splits also help a company look good to investors. When a company's stock price is lower after a split, it might seem less risky to new investors. This can bring in more money for the company because more people are willing to buy its stock. But stock splits are just one part of a company's overall plan. They also think about things like how much money they're making, how they're spending it, and what they want to do in the future. So, a stock split is a tool that can help, but it's not the only thing a company does to grow and succeed.

## What are the tax implications of a stock split for investors?

A stock split doesn't usually change how much tax you have to pay right away. When a company does a stock split, it gives you more shares, but the total value of what you own stays the same. So, you don't have to pay any taxes just because of the split. You only have to think about taxes when you sell your shares. If you sell your shares for more money than you paid for them, you might have to pay capital gains tax on the profit.

Sometimes, a stock split can affect how you handle your taxes later on. If the stock price goes up after the split and you sell your shares, you might have a bigger profit to report. This could mean you pay more in taxes when you sell. But the stock split itself doesn't make you owe any taxes. It's all about what happens when you decide to sell your shares.

## What are Reverse Stock Splits?

Reverse stock splits involve a reduction in the number of a company's outstanding shares while proportionally increasing the price per share. For instance, in a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, ten existing shares are consolidated into one, elevating the share price by a [factor](/wiki/factor-investing) of ten. This corporate maneuver does not alter the company's overall market capitalization. The formula for the new share price following a reverse stock split can be represented as:

$$
\text{New Share Price} = \text{Old Share Price} \times \frac{\text{Old Number of Shares}}{\text{New Number of Shares}}
$$

One primary reason companies execute reverse stock splits is to maintain compliance with stock exchange listing requirements, particularly the minimum bid price. Falling below these thresholds might result in delisting, posing significant challenges for accessing capital markets. Consequently, reverse splits can temporarily buoy share prices above the required minimums.

Moreover, reverse stock splits may signal financial distress or underlying problems within a company. They might be perceived as a negative indicator, suggesting that a company's shares have been persistently low for an extended period, potentially due to dwindling performance or unfavorable market conditions. Such perceptions can affect investor confidence and market perception, even if the reverse split itself does not alter the company's intrinsic value.

For investors, comprehending the implications of reverse stock splits is critical. These events require careful scrutiny of a company's overall health and strategic direction. While a higher share price post-split may provide a psychological boost or momentarily enhance marketability, it does not inherently resolve the underlying issues facing the company. Thus, reverse splits call for a cautious assessment of the broader financial context and their impact on long-term investment strategies.

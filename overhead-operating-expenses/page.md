def calculate_overhead_savings(initial_cost, reduced_cost, period):
    """
    Calculate total savings from overhead cost reduction over a specified period.

    :param initial_cost: Initial overhead cost (monthly).
    :param reduced_cost: New reduced overhead cost (monthly).
    :param period: Number of months for calculation.
    :return: Total savings over the given period.
    """
    monthly_savings = initial_cost - reduced_cost
    total_savings = monthly_savings * period
    return total_savings

# Initial monthly overhead costs: $100,000
# Reduced monthly overhead costs: $85,000
# Period: 12 months

initial_cost = 100000
reduced_cost = 85000
duration = 12

savings = calculate_overhead_savings(initial_cost, reduced_cost, duration)
print(f"Total savings over {duration} months: ${savings}")
```

This code can help businesses visualize potential savings from overhead optimization, aiding in decision-making processes. Such savings directly enhance a firm's profitability, making overhead management a key concern for algorithmic trading businesses seeking long-term growth and sustainability.

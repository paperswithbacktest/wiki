## What is market share and why is it important for airlines?

Market share is the percentage of total sales in an industry that a company has. For airlines, it means how much of the total number of passengers or flights an airline has compared to other airlines. It's like a piece of the pie, where the whole pie is all the passengers or flights in the market.

Market share is important for airlines because it shows how well they are doing compared to their competitors. If an airline has a big piece of the pie, it means more people are choosing to fly with them. This can help the airline make more money and grow bigger. It also helps them understand if their marketing and services are working well. If their market share is small, they might need to change their strategies to attract more passengers.

## How is market share calculated in the airline industry?

Market share in the airline industry is calculated by looking at the number of passengers or the number of flights an airline has compared to the whole market. For example, if an airline carried 100,000 passengers in a year, and the total number of passengers in the market was 1 million, the airline's market share would be 10% (100,000 divided by 1,000,000, then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage).

This calculation can be done using different measures, like the number of passengers, the number of flights, or even the revenue earned. Airlines often use passenger numbers because it directly shows how many people are choosing to fly with them. By comparing their numbers to the total market, airlines can see if they are growing or shrinking compared to other airlines.

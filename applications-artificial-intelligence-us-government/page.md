import pandas as pd

def moving_average_crossover(data, short_window=40, long_window=100):
    data['Short_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    data['Long_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    data['Signal'] = 0
    data['Signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['Short_MA'][short_window:] > data['Long_MA'][short_window:], 1, 0)
    data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()
    return data

historical_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_historical_stock_data.csv')
result = moving_average_crossover(historical_data)
```

This simple algorithm demonstrates the power of automation, enabling traders to consistently apply strategic decisions across a dataset without the need for manual analysis.

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Example of a simple linear regression model for predicting stock prices
def predict_stock_prices(historical_data):
    # Converting timestamp to a numerical format for regression analysis
    historical_data['Date_ordinal'] = pd.to_datetime(historical_data['Date']).map(pd.Timestamp.toordinal)

    X = historical_data[['Date_ordinal']]
    y = historical_data['Close']  # assuming 'Close' is the column for closing prices

    # Fit linear regression model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X, y)

    # Predict future stock prices
    future_dates = pd.DataFrame({'Date': pd.date_range(start=historical_data['Date'].max(), periods=30)})
    future_dates['Date_ordinal'] = pd.to_datetime(future_dates['Date']).map(pd.Timestamp.toordinal)

    predictions = model.predict(future_dates[['Date_ordinal']])

    return future_dates['Date'], predictions

# Sample usage
historical_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Date': ['2023-09-01', '2023-09-02', '2023-09-03'],
    'Close': [100, 102, 105]
})

future_dates, predicted_prices = predict_stock_prices(historical_data)
```

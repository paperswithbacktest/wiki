4. **Momentum Strategies**: These strategies harness prior price movements to forecast future price directions. Algorithms used here are adept at identifying and seizing short- to medium-term gains arising from price momentum, often quantified through momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). Python code implementing a basic momentum strategy might resemble:

   ```python
   def compute_momentum(prices, days=10):
       """
       Calculate the momentum of a stock.
       prices: List or array of stock prices.
       days: Time period for calculating momentum.
       """
       if len(prices) < days:
           return None
       return prices[-1] - prices[-days]

   stock_prices = [10, 11, 13, 12, 15, 18, 20, 19, 23, 22]
   momentum = compute_momentum(stock_prices, days=5)
   print(f"Momentum: {momentum}")
   ```

Each style of style investing is tied to particular algorithmic logic, facilitating the ability of traders to modify tactics in response to changing market dynamics. This adaptability ensures that trading remains effective across different market environments, maximizing the opportunity for optimized returns.

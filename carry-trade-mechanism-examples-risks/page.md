## What is a carry trade?

A carry trade is a strategy where you borrow money in a country where interest rates are low and then use that money to invest in a country where interest rates are higher. The goal is to make a profit from the difference in interest rates between the two countries. For example, if you borrow money in Japan where interest rates are very low, and then invest that money in the United States where interest rates are higher, you could earn more from the interest in the U.S. than you pay in Japan.

However, carry trades can be risky. The value of the currencies can change, which can affect your profits. If the currency you borrowed in (like the Japanese yen) becomes stronger compared to the currency you invested in (like the U.S. dollar), it could reduce your profits or even cause you to lose money. So, while carry trades can be profitable, they also come with a lot of risk because of the uncertainty in currency exchange rates.

## How does the mechanism of a carry trade work?

A carry trade works by borrowing money from a place where the interest rate is low and then using that money to buy an investment in a place where the interest rate is higher. For example, imagine you borrow money in Japan where the interest rate is very low. You take that money and buy a bond in the United States where the interest rate is higher. The difference between the low interest you pay in Japan and the higher interest you earn in the U.S. is your profit.

However, [carry](/wiki/carry-trading) trades can be risky because the value of money between countries can change. If the Japanese yen becomes stronger compared to the U.S. dollar, it could make your profits smaller or even cause you to lose money. You need to pay back the loan in Japanese yen, so if the yen gets stronger, you need more dollars to buy the yen to pay back the loan. This means that even though you might earn more interest in the U.S., changes in currency values can affect whether you make a profit or not.

## What are the typical currencies involved in a carry trade?

In a carry trade, people often use the Japanese yen to borrow money because Japan usually has very low interest rates. They then use this money to buy investments in countries like the United States, Australia, or New Zealand, where interest rates are usually higher. This way, they can earn more money from the difference in interest rates.

Sometimes, people also use the Swiss franc or the euro to borrow money, especially if these currencies have low interest rates. They might then invest in emerging markets like Brazil or Turkey, which can offer even higher interest rates. But, these trades can be riskier because the value of these currencies can change a lot, making it harder to predict if the trade will be profitable.

## Can you provide a simple example of a carry trade?

Imagine you borrow 100,000 Japanese yen from a bank in Japan. The [interest rate](/wiki/interest-rate-trading-strategies) in Japan is very low, so you only have to pay back a little bit more than you borrowed. You then take those 100,000 yen and exchange them for U.S. dollars. With those dollars, you buy a U.S. bond that pays a higher interest rate.

Let's say the interest rate in Japan is 0.1% and the interest rate in the U.S. is 2%. At the end of the year, you have to pay back the bank in Japan about 100,100 yen. But from the U.S. bond, you earn enough dollars to buy back more than 100,100 yen. The difference between what you earn in the U.S. and what you pay back in Japan is your profit. However, if the value of the yen goes up compared to the dollar, it could make your profit smaller or even cause you to lose money.

## What are the potential benefits of engaging in carry trades?

Engaging in carry trades can be a way to make money by taking advantage of the difference in interest rates between two countries. If you borrow money from a country with low interest rates and invest it in a country with higher interest rates, you can earn more from the investment than you pay in interest on the loan. This difference is your profit. For example, if you borrow in Japan where interest rates are low and invest in the U.S. where rates are higher, you can earn money from this interest rate difference.

However, carry trades also come with the potential for high returns if done correctly. If the currency you invest in stays strong or gets stronger compared to the currency you borrowed in, your profits can be even bigger. This is because you need fewer of the currency you invested in to pay back the loan in the currency you borrowed. So, carry trades can be a way to earn more money than just saving or investing in one place, but they do come with risks that need to be carefully managed.

## What are the risks associated with carry trades?

Carry trades can be risky because the value of the money between countries can change a lot. If the currency you borrowed in gets stronger compared to the currency you invested in, it can make your profits smaller or even cause you to lose money. For example, if you borrow in Japanese yen and invest in U.S. dollars, but the yen gets stronger, you will need more dollars to buy back the yen to pay off your loan. This can eat into your profits or turn them into losses.

Another risk is that interest rates can change. If the country you borrowed from raises its interest rates, it can make your loan more expensive. If the country you invested in lowers its interest rates, you might earn less from your investment. Both of these changes can hurt your profits. Also, carry trades can be affected by big events like financial crises or changes in government policies, which can cause sudden and big changes in currency values and interest rates.

Because of these risks, carry trades are not for everyone. They can be a way to make money, but they also come with the chance of losing money. It's important to understand these risks and be ready for them before you start a carry trade.

## How do interest rate differentials affect carry trades?

Interest rate differentials are the key to making money with carry trades. When you borrow money from a country with low interest rates and invest it in a country with higher interest rates, you earn more from your investment than you pay in interest on your loan. For example, if you borrow in Japan where interest rates are very low and invest in the U.S. where rates are higher, the difference between what you earn in the U.S. and what you pay back in Japan is your profit.

However, if the interest rates change, it can affect your carry trade. If the country you borrowed from raises its interest rates, your loan becomes more expensive. If the country you invested in lowers its interest rates, you earn less from your investment. Both of these changes can make your profits smaller or even turn them into losses. So, keeping an eye on interest rate changes is very important when doing carry trades.

## What role do exchange rates play in the success or failure of a carry trade?

Exchange rates are really important for carry trades because they can make a big difference in whether you make money or lose money. If you borrow money in one country and invest it in another, the value of the money between those countries can change. For example, if you borrow Japanese yen and invest in U.S. dollars, but the yen gets stronger compared to the dollar, it will cost you more dollars to buy back the yen to pay off your loan. This can eat into your profits or even turn them into losses.

On the other hand, if the currency you invested in stays strong or gets stronger compared to the currency you borrowed in, your profits can be even bigger. This is because you need fewer of the currency you invested in to pay back the loan in the currency you borrowed. So, changes in exchange rates can either help you make more money or cause you to lose money, depending on how they move. It's important to keep an eye on these changes when you're doing a carry trade.

## How can geopolitical events impact carry trades?

Geopolitical events can shake up carry trades a lot. These events can make the value of money between countries change quickly. For example, if there's a big problem like a war or a new law in a country, it can make people worried about that country's money. If you borrowed money from that country, its money might get weaker, which could help your carry trade. But if you invested in that country, its money getting weaker could hurt your trade and make you lose money.

Also, geopolitical events can change interest rates. If a country is in trouble, its government might change interest rates to try to fix things. If the country you borrowed from raises its interest rates because of a big event, it makes your loan more expensive. If the country you invested in lowers its interest rates, you earn less from your investment. Both of these changes can mess up your carry trade and make it hard to make money. So, it's really important to keep an eye on what's happening around the world when you're doing carry trades.

## What are some advanced strategies used in carry trades?

Some people use a strategy called "currency hedging" to make carry trades safer. This means they do something to protect themselves from big changes in the value of money between countries. They might use special financial tools, like options or futures, to make sure that even if the currency they borrowed in gets stronger, they don't lose too much money. This can make the carry trade less risky, but it also means they might not make as much money because they have to pay for this protection.

Another strategy is to use "diversification." This means not putting all their money into one carry trade but spreading it out over different countries and currencies. By doing this, if one trade doesn't work out because of changes in interest rates or currency values, they might still make money from other trades. This can help balance out the risks and make it more likely they'll end up with a profit at the end of the day.

Some traders also pay close attention to "economic indicators" and "market sentiment." They look at things like how strong a country's economy is, what people think about that country's money, and any news that might affect interest rates or currency values. By keeping an eye on these things, they can try to guess when it's a good time to start or end a carry trade. This can help them make smarter decisions and maybe make more money, but it's still not a sure thing because no one can predict the future perfectly.

## How do market liquidity and volatility influence carry trade outcomes?

Market [liquidity](/wiki/liquidity-risk-premium) is about how easy it is to buy or sell something without changing its price a lot. When there's a lot of liquidity, it's easier to do carry trades because you can quickly change your money from one currency to another without big changes in the exchange rate. But if the market isn't very liquid, it can be harder to do carry trades. You might not be able to buy or sell as much as you want, and the prices might change a lot when you try to trade. This can make your carry trade less profitable or even cause you to lose money.

Volatility is about how much the price of something changes over time. If the currencies you're using in your carry trade are very volatile, it can make things riskier. Big changes in the exchange rate can happen quickly, and this can hurt your profits or turn them into losses. For example, if the currency you borrowed in suddenly gets a lot stronger, you'll need more of the currency you invested in to pay back your loan. This can eat into your profits or make you lose money. So, it's important to think about how much the currencies might change when you're planning a carry trade.

## What historical examples illustrate the risks and rewards of carry trades?

One famous example of carry trade happened during the 2000s, when many people borrowed Japanese yen and used that money to invest in places like Australia and New Zealand. Japan had very low interest rates, so it was cheap to borrow yen. Australia and New Zealand had higher interest rates, so people could earn more money by investing there. For a while, this worked really well, and people made a lot of money. But in 2008, when the global financial crisis hit, things changed fast. The yen got much stronger, and people who had borrowed yen had to pay back a lot more money than they expected. Many people lost money because of this.

Another example is the carry trade that happened with the Swiss franc in the early 2010s. People borrowed Swiss francs because the interest rates were low and used the money to invest in places like Brazil and Turkey, where interest rates were much higher. This worked well for a while, and people made good profits. But in 2015, the Swiss National Bank suddenly stopped supporting the value of the Swiss franc, and it got a lot stronger very quickly. This meant that people who had borrowed Swiss francs had to pay back a lot more money than they planned. Many people lost a lot of money because of this sudden change.

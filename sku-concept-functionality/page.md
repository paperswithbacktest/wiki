```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Example historical data: weeks vs sales
weeks = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape((-1, 1))
sales = np.array([10, 15, 14, 10, 12])

# Apply a linear regression to predict future sales
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(weeks, sales)

# Predict sales for the 6th week
week_6 = np.array([6]).reshape((-1, 1))
predicted_sales = model.predict(week_6)
```

In a similar manner, real-time data empowers automated systems to adjust pricing strategies and promotions dynamically.

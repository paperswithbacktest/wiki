## Understanding Hedge Funds

Hedge funds are investment vehicles primarily structured as private partnerships, accessible only to accredited investors who meet specific financial criteria. These investors typically include high net worth individuals, endowments, pension funds, and institutional investors. This exclusivity allows hedge funds to eschew many regulatory constraints that apply to more publicly accessible investment vehicles, thereby permitting a broader range of investment strategies.

The overarching aim of hedge funds is to achieve high returns while mitigating risk, a goal accomplished through diverse and often complex strategies. Among these are long/short equity, which involves taking long positions in perceived undervalued stocks and short positions in overvalued ones to profit from relative changes in their prices. Market neutral strategies attempt to eliminate market exposure by hedging out the systematic risk inherent to beta-driven market dynamics, focusing on generating alpha independent of market movements. Global macro strategies take directional positions based on forecasts and analyses of economic trends and geopolitical events across countries.

Hedge funds distinguish themselves from traditional investment avenues through the utilization of leverage, derivatives, and short selling, which can enhance both returns and risks. Leverage involves borrowing funds to increase the size of an investment position beyond what would be possible through equity alone, potentially amplifying both gains and losses.

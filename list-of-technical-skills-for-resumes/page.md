# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Generate trading signals
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA_50'][50:] > data['SMA_200'][50:], 1, 0)

# Execute trades based on signals
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Visualize the strategy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(14,7))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price')
plt.plot(data['SMA_50'], label='50-Day SMA')
plt.plot(data['SMA_200'], label='200-Day SMA')
plt.scatter(data.index, data['Position'], label='Buy/Sell Signals', marker='o', color='red')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.show()
```

This code illustrates how technical skills (Python programming and data manipulation) are used to implement a strategy drawn from technical analysis (moving averages) to make data-driven trading decisions. Understanding and applying both technical skills and technical analysis ensure more informed and expedient trading decisions in finance.

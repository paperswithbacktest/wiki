## What is the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)?

The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) is a part of the World Bank Group. It helps investors and lenders to invest in developing countries by providing guarantees against certain risks. These risks include things like war, currency not being able to be taken out of the country, and when governments take over businesses.

MIGA was created to encourage foreign investment in developing countries. It does this by reducing the risks that investors might face. When investors feel safer, they are more likely to invest money in projects that can help grow the economy and improve people's lives in these countries. MIGA works with governments, businesses, and other organizations to make sure these investments happen smoothly and successfully.

## When was MIGA established?

MIGA was set up in 1988. It is part of the World Bank Group. The main goal of MIGA is to help investors feel safe when they put money into developing countries.

MIGA does this by offering guarantees against risks like war, currency transfer issues, and when governments take over businesses. By reducing these risks, MIGA encourages more investment which can help grow economies and improve living conditions in developing countries.

## Who are the members of MIGA?

MIGA has members from all over the world. These members are countries that have joined MIGA to help encourage investment in developing countries. As of now, MIGA has more than 180 member countries. These countries work together to support MIGA's goals of reducing investment risks and promoting economic growth.

Each member country has a say in how MIGA operates. They do this by participating in MIGA's Council of Governors, which is the highest decision-making body of MIGA. The Council of Governors meets once a year to discuss and make important decisions about MIGA's policies and activities. By working together, these member countries help MIGA to be effective in supporting investments that can improve lives in developing countries.

## How does MIGA support economic development?

MIGA supports economic development by making it safer for investors to put money into developing countries. It does this by offering guarantees against risks like war, currency transfer issues, and when governments take over businesses. When investors feel safer, they are more likely to invest in projects that can create jobs, build infrastructure, and improve services like health care and education. This helps the economy grow and makes life better for people in these countries.

MIGA works with governments, businesses, and other organizations to make sure these investments happen smoothly and successfully. By bringing in more foreign investment, MIGA helps developing countries to have more money to spend on things that can improve people's lives. For example, new factories can provide jobs, and new roads and schools can help communities to grow and thrive. Through these efforts, MIGA plays a big role in helping developing countries to develop their economies and improve living conditions.

## What types of guarantees does MIGA offer?

MIGA offers guarantees that protect investors from certain risks when they invest in developing countries. One type of guarantee is against war and civil disturbance. This means if there is a war or other big problems in the country where the investment is, MIGA will help the investor not lose all their money. Another type of guarantee is for currency transfer. This helps if the investor can't take their money out of the country because of rules or problems with the local currency.

MIGA also offers guarantees against when governments take over businesses, which is called expropriation. If the government in the country where the investment is made takes control of the business, MIGA will help the investor get compensated. Lastly, MIGA provides guarantees against when the government does not keep its promises or agreements, known as breach of contract. This helps if the government fails to do what it said it would do, like providing land or services needed for the investment. By offering these guarantees, MIGA makes it safer for investors to put money into developing countries.

## How does MIGA assess and manage risk?

MIGA assesses risk by carefully looking at the country where the investment will be made. They check things like the political situation, how stable the economy is, and any past problems that might affect the investment. MIGA also talks to experts and uses data to understand the risks better. This helps them decide if they can offer a guarantee and how much it will cost.

Once MIGA decides to offer a guarantee, they work to manage the risk. They keep watching the situation in the country to make sure nothing bad happens to the investment. If there are problems, MIGA can step in to help solve them. They might talk to the government or work with other organizations to protect the investor's money. By doing all this, MIGA makes sure the investment stays safe and helps the economy grow.

## What is the process for obtaining a guarantee from MIGA?

To get a guarantee from MIGA, an investor first needs to apply. They fill out an application form and give MIGA details about their project, like where it will be, how much money they are investing, and what kind of risks they are worried about. MIGA will then review the application. They look at the country's situation, the project's details, and the risks involved. If everything looks good, MIGA will decide if they can offer a guarantee and how much it will cost.

Once MIGA agrees to offer a guarantee, the investor and MIGA sign a contract. This contract says what MIGA will do if something bad happens to the investment. MIGA keeps watching the situation in the country to make sure the investment stays safe. If there are problems, like war or the government taking over the business, MIGA will step in to help. They might talk to the government or work with other groups to protect the investor's money. By doing this, MIGA helps the investment stay safe and helps the economy grow.

## Can you provide examples of successful projects supported by MIGA?

One example of a successful project supported by MIGA is the Azura-Edo power plant in Nigeria. MIGA provided guarantees to help build this plant, which now provides electricity to many homes and businesses. This project has helped improve the lives of people in Nigeria by giving them a more reliable source of power. It also created jobs and brought in more investment to the country.

Another example is the Lake Turkana Wind Power Project in Kenya. MIGA's guarantees helped make this big wind farm possible. The wind farm now produces a lot of clean energy, which is good for the environment. It also provides electricity to many people in Kenya and has created jobs for the local community. This project shows how MIGA can support projects that are good for both the economy and the environment.

## How does MIGA collaborate with other international financial institutions?

MIGA works together with other big money organizations to help developing countries grow. One way they do this is by working with the World Bank Group, which includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). MIGA can join forces with the IFC to give money and guarantees to projects that need both. This makes it easier for investors to feel safe about putting money into these projects. MIGA also works with the IBRD to help countries make their economies stronger and to create better conditions for investments.

Another way MIGA collaborates is by partnering with regional development banks like the African Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. These partnerships help MIGA to support projects in specific regions. For example, MIGA might work with the African Development Bank on a project in Africa, using their knowledge of the area to make the project more successful. By working together, MIGA and these banks can bring more money and support to projects that can make a big difference in people's lives.

## What challenges does MIGA face in its operations?

MIGA faces several challenges in its operations. One big challenge is the political situation in the countries where it wants to help. Sometimes, there can be wars or big changes in government that make it hard for MIGA to protect investments. This can make investors worried about putting their money into these countries, even with MIGA's guarantees.

Another challenge is dealing with different rules and regulations in different countries. Each country has its own laws about how investments can work, and sometimes these laws can change quickly. This makes it hard for MIGA to plan and make sure the guarantees they offer will work as expected. MIGA has to work hard to understand these rules and find ways to make sure the investments stay safe.

Lastly, MIGA also faces challenges with money. It costs a lot to offer guarantees and to keep watching over the investments to make sure they are safe. MIGA needs to find enough money to do all this work while keeping the costs of the guarantees low enough so that investors will still want to use them. This can be tough, especially when there are many projects that need help at the same time.

## What are the future prospects and strategic directions for MIGA?

MIGA is looking to the future with plans to help more investors feel safe about putting money into developing countries. They want to focus on projects that can help the environment, like clean energy and fighting climate change. MIGA also wants to support projects that help people, like building hospitals and schools. By doing this, MIGA hopes to bring more money into developing countries and help them grow their economies in a way that is good for everyone.

Another big plan for MIGA is to work more closely with other big money organizations. They want to team up with groups like the World Bank and regional development banks to make sure their guarantees are even stronger. By working together, MIGA can help more projects get off the ground and make a bigger difference in the world. They also want to keep finding new ways to manage risks and make sure their guarantees are as helpful as possible for investors.

import numpy as np

# Assume data is preloaded into a DataFrame with date, sales columns
data = pd.read_csv('automotive_sales_data.csv')
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Calculate rolling averages to identify trends
data['12_month_avg'] = data['sales'].rolling(window=12).mean()

def trading_signal(data, threshold=1.05):
    signals = []
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data['sales'].iloc[i] > data['12_month_avg'].iloc[i] * threshold:
            signals.append('buy')
        elif data['sales'].iloc[i] < data['12_month_avg'].iloc[i] / threshold:
            signals.append('sell')
        else:
            signals.append('hold')

## Historical Overview of the Department of Commerce

The Department of Commerce (DOC) was formed as the Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903, amid calls for better representation of business interests at the federal level. This establishment occurred during a time when economic expansion and industrial growth amplified the need for governmental oversight of commerce. However, the combination of commerce and labor functions under one department quickly revealed internal conflicts, particularly as labor leaders voiced concerns about neglecting labor issues. Consequently, in 1913, the department split into two distinct entities, resulting in the creation of the Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor. This split allowed each department to focus more closely on their respective areas of expertise and policy impact.

Throughout the 20th century, the Department of Commerce evolved substantially to align with the industrial and economic growth of the United States. This expansion included the establishment of various bureaus and offices, which were essential in addressing the increasing complexity of the economy. For example, as the country industrialized, the need for accurate economic data and analysis became more prominent, leading to the development of specialized bureaus within the DOC to manage these tasks.

Significant historical events played crucial roles in shaping the scope and direction of the Department of Commerce. The enactment of the federal income tax in 1913, following the 16th Amendment, provided the government with a more consistent revenue stream, enabling further investment in economic infrastructure and initiatives led by the DOC. Additionally, the department's activities were profoundly influenced by the two World Wars, during which the United States' economy transitioned into a global powerhouse. The DOC facilitated this transformation by promoting foreign trade, ensuring efficient resource allocation, and fostering industrial development to support the war efforts.

## What are Wealthfront and Merrill Guided Investing?

Wealthfront is an online investment platform that helps people manage their money. It uses something called robo-advising, which means a computer program picks and manages your investments for you. Wealthfront is good for people who want to invest but don't want to spend a lot of time doing it themselves. It's easy to use and doesn't cost much money. You just tell Wealthfront how much risk you're okay with, and it picks investments that match your goals.

Merrill Guided Investing is also a robo-advisor service, but it's offered by Merrill Lynch, which is a big bank. Like Wealthfront, it uses a computer to manage your investments based on your goals and how much risk you want to take. But, Merrill Guided Investing also lets you talk to human advisors if you need help or have questions. This might be good for people who want some computer help but also like the idea of talking to a person sometimes. It might cost a bit more than Wealthfront, but you get that extra help when you need it.

## How do the fee structures of Wealthfront and Merrill Guided Investing compare?

Wealthfront has a simple fee structure. They charge 0.25% of the money you have with them each year. This means if you have $10,000 invested, you'll pay $25 a year. Wealthfront doesn't charge you any money to start using their service, and they also don't charge you to take your money out. They make their money just from that yearly fee.

Merrill Guided Investing has a bit different fee setup. For their basic robo-advisor service, they also charge 0.25% per year, just like Wealthfront. But if you want to talk to a human advisor sometimes, you need to use their premium service. The premium service costs 0.80% per year. So, if you have $10,000 invested and use the premium service, you'll pay $80 a year. Like Wealthfront, there are no fees to start or to take your money out.

## What are the minimum investment requirements for each service?

Wealthfront has a pretty low minimum investment. You need just $500 to start using their service. This makes it easier for people who don't have a lot of money to start investing. Once you're in, you can add more money whenever you want, and there's no minimum for adding to your account.

Merrill Guided Investing is a bit different. Their basic robo-advisor service needs a minimum of $1,000 to start. If you want the premium service where you can talk to a human advisor, you need at least $20,000. So, Merrill Guided Investing might be better for people who already have a bit more money to invest.

## What types of investment accounts can be opened with Wealthfront and Merrill Guided Investing?

With Wealthfront, you can open different kinds of investment accounts. They offer a taxable investment account, which is good for saving money and paying taxes on your earnings each year. They also have retirement accounts like a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, which help you save for the future with some tax benefits. If you're saving for your kids' education, you can use a 529 college savings plan. And if you run a business, you can open a SEP-IRA or a Solo 401(k) to save for your own retirement.

Merrill Guided Investing also lets you open several types of accounts. They have a taxable investment account for general investing. For retirement, they offer a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, similar to Wealthfront. If you're saving for education, you can use a 529 plan. And for business owners, they provide a SEP-IRA. The main difference is that Merrill Guided Investing doesn't offer a Solo 401(k), which might be something to think about if you're self-employed and looking for that specific type of retirement account.

## How do the investment strategies of Wealthfront and Merrill Guided Investing differ?

Wealthfront uses a computer program to pick and manage your investments. They focus on something called diversification, which means they spread your money across lots of different types of investments to lower the risk. They mainly use ETFs, which are like baskets of different stocks or bonds. Wealthfront also uses a strategy called tax-loss harvesting, which can help you save money on taxes by selling investments that have lost value and buying similar ones. They adjust your investments based on how much risk you're okay with and what you want to achieve with your money.

Merrill Guided Investing also uses a computer to manage your investments, but they offer a choice between their basic service and a premium one where you can talk to a human advisor. Like Wealthfront, they use ETFs and focus on diversification to spread out risk. Their basic service works a lot like Wealthfront's, using algorithms to pick investments that match your goals and risk level. But with the premium service, you can get advice from a human, which might be helpful if you have questions or want a personal touch. Both services aim to grow your money over time, but Merrill Guided Investing gives you the option for that extra human help if you need it.

## What kind of tax optimization features do Wealthfront and Merrill Guided Investing offer?

Wealthfront has a feature called tax-loss harvesting that helps you save money on taxes. This means if some of your investments lose value, Wealthfront will sell them and buy similar ones. By doing this, you can use the losses to lower the taxes you owe on other gains or income. Wealthfront does this automatically and often, so it's always working to save you money. They also have something called tax-optimized direct indexing, which is another way to manage your investments to save on taxes, but it's only for people with bigger accounts.

Merrill Guided Investing also offers tax-loss harvesting, just like Wealthfront. They use their computer program to find and use losses in your investments to lower your tax bill. If you choose their premium service, you can talk to a human advisor who can give you more personal advice on how to save on taxes.

Wealthfront uses a computer to keep your investments balanced. They check your account every day to make sure your money is spread out the way you want it to be. If things get out of balance, like if one type of investment grows faster than the others, Wealthfront will automatically move your money around to fix it. This helps keep your risk level the same and makes sure your investments match your goals. They do all this without you having to do anything, so it's easy for you.

Merrill Guided Investing also uses a computer to balance your portfolio, but they do it a bit differently. They check your account less often, usually every few months, to see if it needs fixing. If it does, they'll move your money around to keep it in line with your goals and how much risk you want to take. If you're using their premium service, you can also talk to a human advisor who can help decide when and how to rebalance your investments. So, while both services keep your investments balanced, Merrill Guided Investing gives you the option for personal advice if you need it.

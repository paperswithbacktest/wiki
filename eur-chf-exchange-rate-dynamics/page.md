Popular tools and platforms used for algorithmic trading include MetaTrader, NinjaTrader, and TradingView, which provide traders with powerful tools for developing and testing trading strategies. Programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java are commonly utilized to construct and implement algorithms. For instance, the following Python snippet demonstrates a basic moving average crossover strategy:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load historical price data
data = pd.read_csv('forex_data.csv')
data['SMA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Signal Generation
data['Signal'] = np.where(data['SMA50'] > data['SMA200'], 1, 0)
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price')
plt.plot(data['SMA50'], label='50-Day SMA', alpha=0.7)
plt.plot(data['SMA200'], label='200-Day SMA', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Moving Average Crossover Strategy')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.show()
```

This example demonstrates how to implement a basic strategy where a buy signal is generated when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crosses above the 200-day SMA, and a sell signal is triggered when it crosses below. Such strategies can be enhanced with additional indicators and adapted to various market conditions.

# Assume df is a DataFrame containing EUR/CHF historical data with a 'Close' column
df['Mean'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
df['StdDev'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).std()
df['Upper'] = df['Mean'] + (df['StdDev'] * 2)
df['Lower'] = df['Mean'] - (df['StdDev'] * 2)

# Signal to buy
df['Buy_Signal'] = (df['Close'] < df['Lower']).astype(int)

# Signal to sell
df['Sell_Signal'] = (df['Close'] > df['Upper']).astype(int)
```

Trend-following strategies, on the other hand, capitalize on the [momentum](/wiki/momentum) of the market by buying an asset when the price is trending upwards and selling when it is trending downwards. Traders use indicators such as moving averages, MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and momentum oscillators to develop trend-following algorithms.

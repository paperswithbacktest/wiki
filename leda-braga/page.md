## Challenges in the Algo Trading Landscape

Leda Braga, an influential figure in algorithmic trading, has identified several key challenges within the landscape. A significant concern is the alignment between fund managers and allocators, particularly under decision-making pressures. These pressures often arise from the need to deliver consistent returns, which can lead to conflicts of interest and misaligned incentives. Braga emphasizes the importance of clearly defined roles and transparent communication to ensure that both parties share a unified approach to managing investments.

Another challenge in algorithmic trading is the susceptibility to emotional decision-making, especially during periods of financial drawdowns. Emotion-driven decisions can lead to suboptimal outcomes, and for this reason, Braga advocates the use of systematic strategies that aim to mitigate human biases. These strategies rely on data-driven processes and quantitative analysis to maintain objectivity and enhance the consistency of trading decisions.

In the context of fee structures, the industry faces the difficulty of navigating between fixed and performance-based fees. Some managers operate under what is described as a 'blank cheque' system, where clients provide capital without strict performance guidelines, whereas others negotiate fees based on the returns achieved. This disparity can create challenges in maintaining fairness and transparency in client relations. Braga's approach suggests the necessity for a balanced fee structure that aligns the interests of fund managers and their clients, ensuring that performance incentives do not overshadow the overall risk management objectives.

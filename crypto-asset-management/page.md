This mix helps spread risk and potentially improves returns, as different assets may react differently to the same market conditions. The formula for calculating the expected portfolio return, $E(R_p)$, is given by:

$$
E(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot E(R_i)
$$

where $w_i$ is the weight of the $i$-th asset in the portfolio and $E(R_i)$ is the expected return of the $i$-th asset.

### Risk Management and Security

Managing risk and ensuring security are integral to protecting investments from market fluctuations and cyber threats. Effective risk management strategies include setting stop-loss orders, using hedging techniques, and regularly monitoring the market. Security practices involve safeguarding digital assets against unauthorized access through hardware wallets, two-[factor](/wiki/factor-investing) authentication (2FA), and adhering to best practices for key management. Given the prevalence of hacking and fraud efforts, securing digital assets is as critical as the investment strategies applied.

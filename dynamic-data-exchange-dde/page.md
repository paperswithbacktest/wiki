## What is Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)?

Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is a message-based protocol developed by Microsoft. It facilitates the sharing of data between applications in real-time, allowing them to communicate and update information as it changes without manual intervention. This protocol functions by enabling applications to broadcast messages to each other, effectively synchronizing data across different software platforms.

Originally designed for Windows operating systems, DDE allows applications to link to one another and exchange data dynamically. This capability is crucial in environments where data is constantly changing and needs to be updated promptly to ensure information integrity and relevance. For example, once two applications are connected via DDE, updates in one application can automatically reflect in the other, maintaining data synchronization.

In the context of trading, DDE is utilized to ingest real-time market data into analytical tools such as spreadsheets or dedicated trading software. Traders and analysts can leverage this functionality to update market data feeds continually, thus allowing automated systems to execute trading decisions based on the latest data available. By feeding market data into platforms like Microsoft Excel, users can apply various functions for data analysis, forecasting potential market movements, and executing strategies in response to live market conditions.

DDE operates through a set of dynamic links that enable the transfer of data. These links are established using a syntax that typically consists of three components: the application name, the topic, and the item. For example, a DDE link from a trading application to Excel might reference a specific stock quote where updates are automatically reflected in the target cell in Excel. Once established, these links allow continuous data exchange without further user input, reducing latency in data updates crucial for [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) processes.

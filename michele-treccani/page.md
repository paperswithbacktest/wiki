## Michele Treccani

Michele Treccani is an Italian expert in algorithmic trading, quantitative finance, and blockchain technology. With an extensive career that spans academia and the financial industry, Treccani has made notable contributions in risk management, machine learning, and data science. As of the latest update, he holds the position of Head of Market Analytics & Research at the Algorand Foundation in Milan, Lombardy, Italy.

## Early Life and Education

Michele Treccani pursued higher education in theoretical and mathematical physics at the Università degli Studi di Padova, from where he graduated with a Laurea Diploma (M.Sc) in 2001, specializing in string theory. He later continued his academic journey by enrolling in a Ph.D. program at the University of Pavia, focusing on high energy physics and complex systems, areas that would lay the groundwork for his future endeavors in econophysics and algorithmic finance.

## Academic and Early Professional Career

After obtaining his Ph.D. in 2005, Treccani started a series of postdoctoral fellowships and research positions that significantly shaped his expertise in quantitative finance and modeling. Among his earliest roles was at the Università degli Studi di Ferrara, where he developed Monte Carlo codes and conducted phenomenological studies for predictions at Hadron colliders, focusing on scenarios beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.

Treccani then moved to the University of Granada in Spain, where, from 2008 to 2011, he held a Juan de la Cierva Fellowship. His work here revolved around the phenomenological implications of new models of fundamental interactions, particularly those relevant to Tevatron and LHC particle colliders.

Following this, he joined the Istituto de Física Teórica IFT UAM-CSIC at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid as a postdoctoral research fellow. His research during this time continued to delve deeply into the phenomenology of beyond the Standard Model scenarios.

## Transition to Quantitative Finance

Treccani transitioned from theoretical physics to finance with increasing involvement in modeling financial systems and [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading). He gained industry experience as part of the Soft Computing Division at STMicroelectronics, where he developed [neural network](/wiki/neural-network) and genetic algorithms for option pricing. His work here, focusing on the predictive capabilities of these algorithms, was recognized in the publication "Physica A."

His subsequent position as a quantitative analyst at List SpA in Pisa from 2012 to 2014 further cemented his expertise in market microstructure analysis, trading cost analysis, big data, and finance. This role marked his growing influence in the financial sector, as he applied complex simulations and models to practical financial scenarios.

## Career at Mediobanca and Algorand Foundation

In 2014, Treccani joined Mediobanca as a quantitative analyst, specializing in model validation—a critical area in ensuring the reliability and robustness of financial models. He held this position for over seven years, where his work focused largely on validating and implementing risk management strategies.

In July 2021, he became the Head of Market Analytics & Research at the Algorand Foundation. At Algorand, Treccani oversees research and analytics, applying his extensive knowledge of blockchain, big data, and quantitative finance to advance the organization’s strategic initiatives. In this capacity, he leads efforts to innovate and refine blockchain technologies and analytics.

## Research and Publications

Michele Treccani has also contributed significantly to the academic world through various scientific publications. His work often intersects with his professional expertise in finance and includes:

1. *Beyond the Square Root: Evidence for Logarithmic Dependence of Market Impact on Size and Participation Rate* – A study assessing the market impacts and their logarithmic dependencies.

2. *Modelling Systemic Cojumps with Hawkes Factor Models* – Analyzing systemic market movements using advanced statistical models.

3. *Pricing Financial Derivatives with Neural Networks* – Investigating the application of neural networks in derivative markets to enhance pricing accuracy.

4. *Coupling News Sentiment with Web Browsing Data Predicts Intra-Day Stock Prices* – A pioneering attempt to leverage sentiment analysis alongside web-browsing patterns for stock price prediction.

5. *Collective Synchronization and High Frequency Systemic Instabilities in Financial Markets* – A study focusing on the synchronization phenomena in financial markets and the resulting instabilities.

These publications highlight his role at the intersection of finance, [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning), and data interpretation, significantly benefiting algorithmic trading and quantitative strategies.

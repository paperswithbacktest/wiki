class AccessControl:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_roles = {}

    def add_user(self, username, role):
        self.user_roles[username] = role

    def check_access(self, username, resource):
        role = self.user_roles.get(username)
        access_dict = {
            'admin': ['view', 'edit', 'delete'],
            'editor': ['view', 'edit'],
            'viewer': ['view']
        }
        if role and resource in access_dict[role]:
            return True
        return False

# Example usage
ac = AccessControl()
ac.add_user('john_doe', 'editor')
can_edit = ac.check_access('john_doe', 'edit')
```

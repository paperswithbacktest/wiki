Another way to define the largest Canadian software companies is by looking at their market value, which is how much the company is worth on the stock market. This can show how investors see the company's future. Additionally, the company's growth over time is important.

For example, how to handle payments and taxes can be very different in each place. Also, Shopify has to make sure its website works well for people all over the world, which can be hard because people speak different languages and use different types of technology. Another challenge is competition from other big companies that also help people sell things online, like Amazon and eBay.

The best teams or players from each group move on to the next stage, which is often a playoff or knockout stage.

## What are the current challenges facing the esports industry?

One big challenge for the esports industry is making sure that everyone plays fair. Some people use cheats or special programs to win, which is not fair to others. It's hard for organizers to stop this because new cheats can come out all the time. Another problem is keeping the games interesting. People can get tired of playing the same game over and over, so game makers need to keep updating and adding new things to keep players excited.

Another challenge is making money. Running big tournaments costs a lot, and not all of them make enough money back. It's hard to get enough people to watch and buy things to make the tournaments profitable. Also, esports needs to keep growing to stay popular. It has to attract new players and fans, which can be tough when there are so many other fun things to do. But if the industry can solve these problems, it can keep growing and being exciting for everyone.

These let players feel like they are really inside the game, which makes playing more fun and exciting. Also, new tools like better graphics and faster computers help make the games look and play better, which keeps people interested.

Another way technology is helping esports is through streaming and social media. With better streaming services, more people can watch esports events live and share them with friends. This makes esports more popular and helps it grow. Also, new ways of using data and AI are making the games smarter. They can help players get better by giving them tips and showing them what they need to work on. All these changes are making esports more fun to play and watch, and they are helping the industry grow even bigger.

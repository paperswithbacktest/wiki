```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Example data: features and target outcome
X = np.array([...])  # Feature set representing player statistics, team performance, etc.
y = np.array([...])  # Target outcomes (e.g., win/loss)

# Splitting data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Logistic Regression Model
logistic_model = LogisticRegression()
logistic_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Neural Network Model
nn_model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(50, 25), max_iter=1000)
nn_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
logistic_predictions = logistic_model.predict(X_test)
nn_predictions = nn_model.predict(X_test)
```

In-game transactions also benefit from the precision and efficiency of algo trading. As esports titles increasingly incorporate virtual economies and marketplaces, algorithmic trading can enhance the speed and fluidity of these transactions.

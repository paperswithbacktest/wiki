## Early Life and Education

James Kleeman was born and raised in the United States. A dedicated learner from a young age, Kleeman's early educational journey was marked by academic success and a curiosity that spanned multiple domains. He attended the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, where he pursued a Bachelor of Science in Physics and Computer Science, along with a minor in Japanese. His early engagement with computer science and his proficiency in Japanese were complemented by his achievements, including being an Eagle Scout and receiving the National Merit Scholarship. 

Pursuing his passion for physics further, Kleeman enrolled at Tohoku University in Japan, where he completed both his Master's and Doctoral studies in Physics between 2010 and 2015. His time in Japan was marked by significant research and exploration into condensed matter physics, with a concentration on bilayer graphene intercalation compounds. His research was recognized with honors such as the MEXT Research Student Scholarship and the Honors Scholarship for Privately Financed International Students.

## Academic and Research Contributions

During his tenure at Tohoku University, Kleeman was heavily engaged in research that centered on the electronic properties of novel materials. His work on bilayer graphene intercalation compounds, which consist of "bread" layers of carbon with metal inserted between, was pivotal in understanding these materials' characteristics, including their superconductivity potential. His scientific achievements earned him accolades such as the Editor's Choice Award for his research contributions.

He designed and implemented experiments utilizing advanced techniques like x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to analyze the properties of these materials. Alongside, he developed automated analysis algorithms to efficiently process spectrographic image data, and used software like Quantum Espresso for material simulations, which guided his experimental objectives.

Kleeman's publication efforts were substantial, including articles such as "Enhancement of electron–phonon coupling in Cs-overlayered intercalated bilayer graphene" and "Anisotropic electron-phonon coupling in Rb-intercalated bilayer graphene". These works contributed significantly to the field of condensed matter physics. 

## Career in Algorithmic Trading

In 2015, James Kleeman transitioned from academia to the world of finance, joining Akuna Capital in the Greater Chicago Area as a Senior Quantitative Developer. His role at Akuna Capital signaled a shift from pure scientific exploration to the application of quantitative analysis in financial markets, specifically focusing on [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading). At Akuna, Kleeman leads a team specializing in the discovery and implementation of advanced quoting strategies, emphasizing market microstructure and creating optimizations tailored to specific financial products and exchanges.

Under his guidance, his team focuses on designing strategies that exploit detailed exchange mechanics to minimize latency and capitalize on market inefficiencies. This involves analyzing tick data from significant exchanges such as CME, CBOE, and Nasdaq. The strategies and solutions developed have transformed trading operations by bridging various disciplines including trading, quantitative analysis, and infrastructure development. Kleeman's adeptness with Python and distributed workflows has been instrumental in this interdisciplinary approach.

## Publications and Recognitions

Kleeman's work has been recognized within the domain and beyond, as evidenced by the breadth of his research publications. In addition to his scientific publications, his work titled "Enabling Patients Online Access To Their Health Records" reflects his diverse research interests.

## Personal Skills and Languages

Beyond his professional endeavors, James Kleeman is proficient in both English and Japanese, which reflects his commitment to cross-cultural engagement and communication. His background in experimental and solid-state physics lends itself not just to his academic publications but also to his practical work in algorithmic trading, showcasing an ability to traverse and integrate diverse fields.

## Legacy and Influence

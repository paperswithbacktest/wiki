   ```python
   import os
   import binascii
   import hashlib
   import base58
   from ecdsa import SigningKey, SECP256k1

   def generate_private_key():
       return binascii.hexlify(os.urandom(32)).decode('utf-8')

   def private_key_to_wif(private_key_hex):
       extended_key = "80" + private_key_hex
       first_sha256 = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(extended_key)).hexdigest()
       second_sha256 = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(first_sha256)).hexdigest()
       checksum = second_sha256[:8]
       wif = extended_key + checksum
       return base58.b58encode(binascii.unhexlify(wif)).decode('utf-8')

   private_key = generate_private_key()
   wif_key = private_key_to_wif(private_key)
   print(f"Private Key: {private_key}")
   print(f"WIF Private Key: {wif_key}")
   ```

### Backup Strategies

A comprehensive backup strategy is indispensable for cold wallets to prevent permanent loss of access to your Bitcoin.

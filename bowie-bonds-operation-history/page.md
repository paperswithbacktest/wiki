## What are Bowie Bonds?

Bowie Bonds were a type of financial instrument created by David Bowie in 1997. They were named after him because he used them to raise money. Bowie sold bonds to investors, and in return, he promised to pay them back with interest. The money he got from selling these bonds came from the future royalties of his songs recorded before 1990. This meant that the investors would get money from the songs' earnings over time.

The idea behind Bowie Bonds was to help artists like Bowie get money right away instead of waiting for royalties to come in slowly over many years. It was a new way for musicians to manage their finances. However, the success of Bowie Bonds depended a lot on the popularity of his music. If people stopped buying and listening to his old songs, the bonds wouldn't be worth as much. In the end, the bonds were sold to Prudential Financial, and they did well until the music industry changed a lot because of the internet and digital music.

## Who created Bowie Bonds and why?

David Bowie created Bowie Bonds in 1997. He worked with a banker named David Pullman to come up with this idea. Bowie Bonds were a way for Bowie to get money right away instead of waiting for royalties from his old songs. He sold these bonds to investors, promising to pay them back with interest using the money he would earn from his songs recorded before 1990.

Bowie Bonds work by letting artists like David Bowie get money right away instead of waiting for royalties from their old songs. In 1997, David Bowie created these bonds and sold them to investors.

So, the investors would get payments over time from the earnings of those songs.

The idea was to help artists manage their money better. Instead of getting small royalty payments over many years, Bowie got a big amount of money all at once. This money could be used for new projects or investments. The success of the bonds depended on how popular Bowie's old songs stayed. If people kept buying and listening to his music, the bonds would do well. But if the songs became less popular, the bonds wouldn't be worth as much. In the end, changes in the music industry, like the rise of digital music, affected the value of the bonds.

Changes in the music industry really affected the value of Bowie Bonds. At first, the bonds did well because people were still buying and listening to David Bowie's old songs. The investors got their payments on time, and everything seemed to be going okay. But then, the internet and digital music started to change everything. People began to buy fewer CDs and more digital music, which meant less money from royalties.

Because of these changes, the royalties from Bowie's old songs went down. This made it harder for Bowie to pay back the investors with the interest he promised. The bonds lost a lot of their value because they depended on how much money the old songs could make. In the end, the rise of digital music and new ways of listening to music made the Bowie Bonds not worth as much as they used to be.

Investing in Bowie Bonds came with some big risks. One main risk was that the money from the bonds depended on how well David Bowie's old songs did. If people stopped buying and listening to his music, the royalties would go down. This meant that investors might not get back all the money they put in, plus the interest they were promised. It was a big risk because the music industry can change a lot, and what's popular today might not be popular tomorrow.

Another risk was the big changes in the music industry. When Bowie Bonds were first sold in 1997, CDs were still very popular. But then, the internet and digital music came along. People started buying less CDs and more digital music, which meant less money from royalties. This made it harder for Bowie to pay back the investors.

This meant that the royalties from Bowie's old songs went down. It became harder for Bowie to pay back the investors with the interest he promised. The value of the bonds dropped because they depended on how much money the old songs could make. In the end, the rise of digital music made the Bowie Bonds not worth as much as they used to be, and the market saw them as riskier than before.

## What lessons can be learned from the Bowie Bonds experience?

The Bowie Bonds experience teaches us that it's important to think about how things might change in the future. When David Bowie sold his bonds in 1997, he got a lot of money right away from his old songs. But he didn't know that the music industry would change so much because of the internet and digital music. If he had thought about these changes, he might have made different choices. This shows that when you make big financial decisions, you need to look at what might happen down the road, not just what's happening right now.

Another lesson from Bowie Bonds is that depending on one thing for money can be risky. The bonds were tied to the royalties from Bowie's old songs. If those songs stayed popular, everything was fine. But when people started buying less CDs and more digital music, the royalties went down, and the bonds lost value. This teaches us that it's good to spread out your money and not put all of it into one thing. That way, if one thing doesn't do well, you still have other things to fall back on.

import pandas as pd

# Example price data
prices = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': pd.date_range(start='1/1/2020', periods=100),
    'price': np.random.rand(100) * 100
})

# Calculate moving averages
short_window = 40
long_window = 100

signals = pd.DataFrame(index=prices.index)
signals['price'] = prices['price']
signals['short_mavg'] = prices['price'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
signals['long_mavg'] = prices['price'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

# Generate signals
signals['signal'] = 0.0
signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                            > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
```

Such practical training not only enhances an accountant’s competency but also ensures they are well-versed in identifying, assessing, and advising on the impact of automated trading decisions on financial outcomes.

NASBA’s ongoing commitment to professional education reflects a proactive approach to navigating the challenges and opportunities that algorithmic trading presents. By equipping accountants with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, NASBA reinforces their ability to provide informed, competent service and uphold the high standards of the profession.

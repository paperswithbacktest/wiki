}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate moving averages
df['short_ma'] = df['price'].rolling(window=2).mean()
df['long_ma'] = df['price'].rolling(window=4).mean()

# Define trading signals
df['signal'] = 0
df['signal'][df['short_ma'] > df['long_ma']] = 1
df['signal'][df['short_ma'] < df['long_ma']] = -1

print(df)
```

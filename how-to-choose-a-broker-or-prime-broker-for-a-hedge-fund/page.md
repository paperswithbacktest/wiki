    - Type of strategies employed (long/short, arbitrage, global macro, etc.)
    - Asset class involved (equities, bonds, derivatives, commodities, etc.)
    - Frequency of transactions (high-frequency trading, daily trading, long-term positions)
    - Fund size and desired level of leverage
2. **Financial strength and reputation**:
    - Make sure the broker is financially sound and has an impeccable reputation.
    - Take rating agency assessments into account.
3. **Costs and fees**:
    - Study the structure of commissions and other associated fees.
    - Some brokers may offer discounts based on transaction volume.
4. **Market access**:
    - Make sure the broker offers access to all the markets in which you wish to operate.
    - Evaluate the quality of order execution and speed of execution.
5. **Additional services**:
    - Some prime brokers offer services such as securities lending, provision of capital, market analysis, etc.
    - Assess the quality and suitability of these services for your fund.
6. **Technology and platforms**:
    - Make sure the broker offers a technology platform that meets your needs, including algorithmic trading, backtesting and reporting.
    - The quality of technical support is also crucial.
7. **Customer service**:
    - Customer service responsiveness and expertise are essential, especially during tense market situations.
    - Also consider the broker's ability to provide personalized services.
8. **Regulation**:
    - Make sure the broker is well regulated in the jurisdiction where it operates.
    - Also assess the protection offered in the event of the broker's bankruptcy.
9. **Networking**:
    - A good prime broker can introduce the hedge fund to potential investors or other useful partners.
10. **Contractual flexibility**:
    - Study the contract terms and make sure they are flexible and tailored to your needs.

It is highly recommended to meet with several brokers and prime brokers to evaluate their offers. It may also be useful to consult other hedge fund managers for recommendations and feedback. Once the choice has been made, a regular review of the partnership is advisable to ensure that the broker continues to meet the fund's needs.

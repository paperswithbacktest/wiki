```python
def execute_trade(order, current_price, smart_contract):
    if order['type'] == 'buy' and order['price'] >= current_price:
        smart_contract.execute_buy(order['amount'])
    elif order['type'] == 'sell' and order['price'] <= current_price:
        smart_contract.execute_sell(order['amount'])
```

Ethereum's smart contracts play a crucial role in automating trade executions based on predefined conditions. These self-executing contracts [carry](/wiki/carry-trading) out trades automatically when certain criteria are met, such as price thresholds or timing conditions.

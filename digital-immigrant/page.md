def moving_average_crossover(data):
    short_window = 40
    long_window = 100

    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Create short and long simple moving averages
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

    # Generate buy/sell signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Create positions
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

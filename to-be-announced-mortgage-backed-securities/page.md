def simple_algo_trade(prices):
    window_size = 5
    moving_averages = moving_average(prices, window_size)
    buy_signals = []
    sell_signals = []

    for i in range(len(moving_averages)):
        if prices[i + window_size - 1] > moving_averages[i] * 1.05:
            sell_signals.append(i + window_size - 1)
        elif prices[i + window_size - 1] < moving_averages[i] * 0.95:
            buy_signals.append(i + window_size - 1)

    return buy_signals, sell_signals

historical_prices = [100, 102, 101, 104, 102, 107, 105, 110]
buy, sell = simple_algo_trade(historical_prices)
print("Buy Signals:", buy)

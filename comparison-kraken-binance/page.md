Kraken also offers different services like staking, where you can earn rewards by holding certain cryptocurrencies.

## How do Kraken and Binance differ in terms of user interface and experience?

However, some users might find it less intuitive at first, especially if they're used to more modern designs. Kraken focuses on providing a secure and reliable experience, so while it might not be the flashiest, it's trusted by many for its safety and stability.

Binance, on the other hand, has a more modern and sleek user interface that many users find more appealing and easier to navigate. When you open Binance, you'll see a lot of options right away, like different types of trading (spot, futures, etc.) and tools to help you make decisions.

## What are the fee structures for trading on Kraken versus Binance?

Kraken has different fees depending on what you're doing. For trading, they use a maker-taker model. Makers add [liquidity](/wiki/liquidity-risk-premium) to the market and pay lower fees, while takers take liquidity and pay higher fees. The fees can range from 0% to 0.26% for makers and 0.10% to 0.26% for takers, depending on your trading [volume](/wiki/volume-trading-strategy) over the last 30 days. If you're just buying or selling crypto with a bank transfer or card, the fees can be higher, up to 3.75% plus a small fixed fee. Kraken's fees can seem a bit complicated, but they're pretty standard for the industry.

Binance also uses a maker-taker fee model, but their fees are generally lower than Kraken's. For makers, the fee can be as low as 0.01%, and for takers, it's 0.01% to 0.10%, depending on your trading volume and whether you're using BNB to pay the fees. If you pay with BNB, you can get a discount on your trading fees. For buying crypto with a card or bank transfer, Binance charges a fee of around 0.5% to 2%, which is usually less than what Kraken charges. Overall, Binance is known for having lower fees, which is one reason why many people choose to trade there.

## Which cryptocurrencies can be traded on Kraken but not on Binance, and vice versa?

Kraken has some special cryptocurrencies that you can't find on Binance. For example, you can trade Tether Gold (XAUT) on Kraken, which is a token backed by physical gold. Another one is Augur (REP), which is used for betting on the outcome of events. These are just a couple of examples, and Kraken might have other unique cryptocurrencies too.

They also have a bug bounty program where people can earn money for finding and reporting security issues, which helps keep the platform safe.

Binance also focuses a lot on security, but they've had some problems in the past. In 2019, hackers stole a lot of money from Binance, but the company paid back all the affected users. Since then, Binance has improved its security a lot. They use cold storage too, and they have 2FA to protect your account.

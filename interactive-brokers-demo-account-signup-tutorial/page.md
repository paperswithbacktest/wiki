## What are the limitations of using an Interactive Brokers demo account compared to a live account?

Using an Interactive Brokers demo account has some limitations compared to a live account. One big difference is that a demo account uses virtual money, so you don't feel the same emotions as when you're using real money. This means you might take more risks in the demo account than you would in a live account. Also, demo accounts might not show real-time market data or might have delays, which can affect how accurate your practice trades are.

Another limitation is that some features might not work the same way in a demo account as they do in a live account. For example, certain advanced trading tools or specific order types might be limited or not available in the demo version. This can make it harder to fully practice all the strategies you might want to use when you start trading for real. So, while a demo account is great for learning, it's important to remember these differences when you move to a live account.

## What is NEO cryptocurrency?

NEO is a type of cryptocurrency, similar to Bitcoin or Ethereum. It's used on a platform called NEO, which helps people create and run digital apps and smart contracts. Smart contracts are like computer programs that automatically do things when certain conditions are met. NEO is sometimes called "Chinese Ethereum" because it's popular in China and works in a similar way to Ethereum.

One special thing about NEO is that it has a limited number of coins, only 100 million. This is different from some other cryptocurrencies that can keep making more coins. Also, NEO holders get to vote on who runs the network, which is a way to keep the system fair and secure. This voting system is part of what makes NEO unique.

## Who founded NEO and when was it launched?

NEO was founded by a person named Da Hongfei. He started working on it in 2014. Da Hongfei is from China and he wanted to create a platform that could help people build and use digital apps and smart contracts easily.

NEO was officially launched in 2016. At first, it was called AntShares, but later it was renamed to NEO. The name change happened to better reflect what the platform was all about - creating a new economy with digital assets and smart contracts.

## How does NEO differ from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum?

NEO is different from Bitcoin and Ethereum in a few key ways. First, NEO has a fixed total supply of only 100 million coins, which is much less than Bitcoin's 21 million or Ethereum's unlimited supply. This makes NEO more scarce, which some people think could make it more valuable over time. Also, NEO uses a different way to keep its network secure and running smoothly. Instead of using a lot of computer power like Bitcoin does with mining, NEO uses a system called "delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance" (dBFT). This means that NEO holders can vote for people to help run the network, making it more democratic and efficient.

Another big difference is how NEO and Ethereum handle smart contracts. Both platforms let you create and run smart contracts, but NEO's smart contracts are designed to be easier to use and more secure. NEO also has a feature called "digital assets" which lets you create and manage different types of digital things, like tokens or shares in a company. This makes NEO a good choice for businesses that want to use blockchain technology. Ethereum, on the other hand, is more focused on being a general platform for all kinds of apps and smart contracts, and it has a bigger community and more developers working on it.

## What are the basic features of NEO?

NEO has a few basic features that make it special. One of them is that it has a fixed total supply of only 100 million coins. This means there will never be more NEO coins made, which can make them more valuable because they are scarce. Another feature is how NEO keeps its network safe and running. Instead of using a lot of computer power like Bitcoin does, NEO uses a system called "delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance" (dBFT). This means that people who own NEO can vote for others to help run the network, making it more fair and efficient.

NEO also has a feature called smart contracts, which are like computer programs that do things automatically when certain conditions are met. NEO's smart contracts are designed to be easy to use and safe. Another important feature is that NEO lets you create and manage different types of digital things, called "digital assets." This can be useful for businesses that want to use blockchain technology to manage tokens or shares in a company. Overall, these features make NEO a unique and useful [cryptocurrency](/wiki/cryptocurrency).

## How can someone acquire NEO tokens?

Someone can acquire NEO tokens by buying them on a cryptocurrency exchange. These are websites where you can trade one type of cryptocurrency for another or for regular money. You'll need to sign up for an account on the exchange, deposit money or another cryptocurrency, and then use that to buy NEO. Some popular exchanges where you can buy NEO include Binance, Coinbase, and Huobi. Just make sure to do some research and choose a trustworthy exchange.

Another way to get NEO tokens is through a process called "airdrops." Sometimes, projects related to NEO will give away free tokens to people who already own NEO. You might need to sign up for these airdrops and meet certain conditions, like holding a certain amount of NEO in your digital wallet at a specific time. Airdrops can be a nice way to get more NEO without spending money, but they are less common and not something you can rely on.

Lastly, you can also earn NEO tokens by participating in the network's governance. Since NEO uses a voting system to decide who runs the network, you can earn small rewards by voting for the people who help manage the network. This isn't a way to get a lot of NEO quickly, but it's a way to get a little bit more over time if you're already holding some NEO.

## What is the significance of NEO's dual token system with NEO and GAS?

NEO uses a special system with two types of tokens: NEO and GAS. NEO tokens are the main tokens, and they are like the shares in the NEO network. When you own NEO, you can vote for who helps run the network, and you can't split NEO into smaller pieces. This means you can only own whole NEO tokens, not fractions. This makes NEO tokens more valuable because they are scarce and can't be divided.

GAS, on the other hand, is used to pay for things on the NEO network, like running smart contracts. When you own NEO, you get GAS over time, kind of like [earning](/wiki/earning-announcement) interest. You can use this GAS to do things on the network or sell it to others. This dual token system helps keep the NEO network running smoothly because it separates the ownership (NEO) from the costs of using the network (GAS).

## How does NEO support smart contracts and what programming languages are supported?

NEO supports smart contracts by making them easy to use and safe. Smart contracts are like computer programs that do things automatically when certain conditions are met. On the NEO platform, you can create and run these smart contracts to do things like manage digital assets or run a business. NEO's smart contracts are designed to be secure, so you don't have to worry about them being hacked or messed up. This makes it a good choice for people who want to use blockchain technology for their projects.

NEO supports several programming languages for writing smart contracts, which makes it easier for more people to use. You can write smart contracts in languages like C#, Java, Python, and Go. This is helpful because many developers already know these languages, so they don't have to learn a new one to start working with NEO. By supporting these common languages, NEO makes it easier for developers to create and manage smart contracts on its platform.

## What are some real-world applications of NEO?

NEO is used in the real world for things like managing digital assets and running smart contracts. For example, companies can use NEO to create digital tokens that represent shares in their business. This makes it easier for them to manage who owns what and to trade these shares on the blockchain. Another use is for supply chain management, where NEO can help track products from the factory to the store, making sure everything is done correctly and on time.

Another real-world application of NEO is in the gaming industry. Developers can use NEO to create in-game items that players can own and trade securely. This can make games more fun and valuable because players can have real ownership of their digital items. Also, NEO can be used for identity verification, helping to keep online services safe and secure by making sure people are who they say they are.

## How does NEO handle scalability and transaction speed?

NEO handles scalability and transaction speed by using a special system called "delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance" (dBFT). This system is different from what other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use. Instead of making everyone on the network solve hard math problems to add new transactions, NEO lets a small group of people, chosen by voting, handle the work. This makes the network faster because fewer people need to agree on each new transaction. It also helps the network handle more transactions at once, making it more scalable.

Because of this system, NEO can process transactions much faster than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin might take 10 minutes or more to confirm a transaction, NEO can do it in just a few seconds. This speed is important for businesses and other uses where you need things to happen quickly. Plus, the voting system means that the network can grow and change as more people use it, without slowing down or getting too crowded.

## What is the role of NEO in decentralized applications (dApps)?

NEO plays a big role in helping people create and use decentralized applications, or dApps. These are apps that run on a blockchain, which means they don't need a central company to control them. Instead, they work on a network of computers all over the world. NEO makes it easy for developers to build these dApps by supporting smart contracts, which are like computer programs that do things automatically when certain conditions are met. This means that dApps on NEO can do things like manage digital assets or run a business without needing a middleman.

NEO also helps dApps by making them faster and more scalable. It uses a special system called "delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance" (dBFT) to handle transactions quickly. This means that dApps on NEO can process transactions in just a few seconds, which is much faster than some other blockchains. Plus, NEO's system lets the network grow and handle more users without slowing down. This makes NEO a good choice for developers who want to build dApps that are fast, secure, and can be used by a lot of people.

## What are the governance and voting mechanisms in the NEO ecosystem?

In the NEO ecosystem, governance and voting are important because they help decide who gets to run the network. NEO uses a system called "delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance" (dBFT). This means that people who own NEO tokens can vote for others to help manage the network. These chosen people are called "consensus nodes" or "validators." They are responsible for making sure that transactions are added to the blockchain correctly and that the network stays safe and works well.

Voting in NEO is pretty straightforward. If you own NEO tokens, you can vote for up to 7 different consensus nodes. The more NEO tokens you have, the more voting power you get. This means that people with more NEO have a bigger say in who runs the network. Voting happens regularly, and the results can change who the consensus nodes are. This system helps keep the network fair and democratic because everyone who owns NEO gets a chance to vote.

## What are the future developments and roadmaps for NEO?

NEO has big plans for the future. They want to make their platform even better and easier to use. One of the main things they are working on is something called "NEO 3.0." This is a big update that will make the network faster and more secure. They also want to make it easier for developers to build apps on NEO by adding more tools and support. Another important part of their plan is to grow their community and get more people using NEO around the world.

Another thing NEO is focusing on is making their platform work better with other blockchains. This means that apps built on NEO can talk to apps on other blockchains, which can make everything more useful and connected. They also want to keep improving their smart contract system to make it even safer and easier to use. Overall, NEO's future plans are all about making their platform stronger, faster, and more connected to the rest of the blockchain world.

## Early Life and Education

Alex Woodfinden was born and raised in Canada, where his early interests in science and mathematics were fostered by an education in physics and computer science. His academic journey began at McMaster University, where he pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Honours Physics with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics, graduating in 2017. Here, he demonstrated remarkable organizational and leadership capabilities, particularly through his role as a Teaching Assistant. Woodfinden managed first-year physics labs and tutorials, imparting foundational scientific knowledge to approximately 40 students each semester, along with being a Research Assistant involved in large data projects and high-performance computing using facilities like SciNet.

After completing his undergraduate education, Woodfinden continued his academic pursuits at Queen's University, where he earned a Master of Science in Astrophysics in 2019. Under the supervision of Dr. J. Irwin, he delved into the complex realm of extragalactic magnetic dynamos, fusing observational data with theoretical dynamo actions. This research not only marked his capability in astrophysical inquiry but also led to a systematized pipeline for data modelling and analysis using Python and Maple, culminating in his first-author publication in a respected journal.

Woodfinden's academic endeavors crescendoed at the University of Waterloo, where he pursued a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Astrophysics from September 2019 to July 2023. Throughout his doctoral studies, he demonstrated expertise in statistics, data analysis, and machine learning techniques. Leading the development of an advanced data analysis pipeline, he achieved significant scholarly milestones, with two first-author publications and notable contributions to three additional publications. His work, heavily reliant on high-performance computational resources, required over 200 CPU years annually, highlighting his adeptness at handling extensive datasets and computations.

## Research and Contributions

Woodfinden's research primarily focuses on the understanding and interpretation of cosmic structures within the universe, encapsulated in his work with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). His contributions to cosmological measurements, particularly through void-galaxy and galaxy-galaxy clustering, have been captured in scientific publications such as "Measurements of cosmic expansion and growth rate of structure from voids in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey between redshift 0.07 and 1.0". Another notable publication is "The completed SDSS-IV extended baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: geometry and growth from the anisotropic void–galaxy correlation function in the luminous red galaxy sample", which reflects his deep engagement with the complexities of cosmic expansion and structural growth.

Woodfinden's research outputs significantly contribute to the broader astrophysical discourse, offering insights into the dynamical behavior of galactic formations and the influences of varying cosmic forces. His work on evolving galactic dynamos, as well as on the axially symmetric galactic dynamos, has added layers of understanding to the field, providing context for the reversal of rotation measures in galactic halos, such as that observed in NGC 4631.

## Professional Career

In the professional domain, Alex Woodfinden transitioned his analytical and computational skills to the financial sector. His career began with a Summer Technology Analyst position at Morgan Stanley in 2016, where he engaged with the Prime Brokerage Funding and Finance Technology division. He leveraged diverse technologies like Greenplum, Hadoop, Hive, and Spark to enhance performance metrics of regulatory reporting software.

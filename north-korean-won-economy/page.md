## What is the North Korean Won?

The North Korean Won is the official money used in North Korea. It is used by people in North Korea to buy things like food, clothes, and other things they need. The symbol for the North Korean Won is ₩, and it is divided into 100 smaller units called chon, though chon are not used much anymore.

The North Korean government controls the value of the Won and how much people can have. This means the government decides how much the Won is worth compared to other countries' money. Sometimes, the government changes the value of the Won, which can make things confusing for people who live in North Korea and for people who want to visit or do business there.

## How is the North Korean Won abbreviated?

The North Korean Won is abbreviated as KPW. This is the short way to write about the money used in North Korea.

When people talk about money in North Korea, they might use KPW to make it easier and quicker. It's like a nickname for the North Korean Won.

## What are the denominations of the North Korean Won?

The North Korean Won comes in different amounts of money, which are called denominations. For paper money, you can find notes worth 5 Won, 10 Won, 50 Won, 100 Won, 200 Won, 500 Won, 1000 Won, 2000 Won, and 5000 Won. These are the different amounts of money that you can have in paper form in North Korea.

For coins, the North Korean Won has coins that are worth 1 Won, 5 Won, 10 Won, 50 Won, and 100 Won. These coins are smaller and can be used to buy things that cost less money. Both the paper money and the coins are used every day by people in North Korea to buy things they need.

## How does the North Korean government control its currency?

The North Korean government has a lot of control over its money, called the North Korean Won. They decide how much the Won is worth compared to other countries' money. This is called setting the exchange rate. The government can change this rate whenever they want, which means the value of the Won can go up or down quickly. They do this to help their own country's economy, but it can make things hard for people who want to buy things from other countries or for tourists visiting North Korea.

The government also controls how much money people in North Korea can have. They do this by setting rules about how much money people can take out of the country or how much they can exchange for other currencies. This is called capital controls. By doing this, the government tries to keep more money inside North Korea. Sometimes, they even change the money itself, like when they introduced new banknotes and made the old ones worthless. This is called redenomination, and it can be confusing and difficult for people living there.

## What is the current exchange rate of the North Korean Won to the US Dollar?

The North Korean Won's exchange rate to the US Dollar can be hard to know for sure because North Korea controls its money tightly. But, people who study money say that around May 2023, 1 US Dollar was about 8,900 North Korean Won in the unofficial market. This is different from the official rate that the North Korean government says, which can be much lower.

The difference between the official and unofficial rates happens because the government wants to keep the Won looking strong. But, in the real world, people in North Korea need more Won to buy things from other countries. So, they use the unofficial market to get a better idea of what their money is really worth.

## How does North Korea's economy function?

North Korea's economy is run by the government. The government decides what gets made, how much it costs, and who gets to work where. Most businesses, like factories and farms, are owned by the state. This means that the government tells them what to do. The government also controls the money, called the North Korean Won, and they can change its value or how much people can have. This tight control is meant to help the country be self-sufficient, but it can make life hard for people who want to buy things from other countries or for tourists.

Because North Korea is isolated from much of the world, it doesn't trade a lot with other countries. This makes it hard for them to get things they need, like food and medicine. The government tries to make sure everyone has enough to live on, but sometimes there isn't enough to go around. People in North Korea often have to rely on what they can grow or make themselves. The government also has special markets where people can buy and sell things, but these are still controlled by the state. Overall, the economy is focused on keeping the country running, even if it means people have to make do with less.

## What are the main industries in North Korea?

North Korea has a few main industries that help keep the country running. One big industry is mining. They dig up things like coal, iron ore, and other minerals from the ground. These resources are important because they can be used to make energy and other things the country needs. Another important industry is manufacturing. North Korea makes things like textiles, which are fabrics for clothes, and machinery. They also make military equipment, which is important for their defense.

Farming is another key industry in North Korea. The country grows crops like rice, corn, and potatoes to feed its people. The government tries to make sure there's enough food for everyone, but sometimes it's hard because of bad weather or not enough resources. Fishing is also important, as it provides another source of food. The government controls all these industries and decides what gets made and how it's shared among the people.

## How does North Korea's economy compare to its neighbors, South Korea and China?

North Korea's economy is very different from its neighbors, South Korea and China. North Korea is a closed economy, which means the government controls almost everything. They decide what gets made, how much it costs, and who gets to work where. Most businesses are owned by the state, and the country doesn't trade much with the rest of the world. This makes it hard for North Korea to get things like food and medicine from other countries. The economy focuses on being self-sufficient, but this often means people have to make do with less.

South Korea, on the other hand, has a very open and advanced economy. It's known for its technology, cars, and big companies like Samsung and Hyundai. South Korea trades a lot with other countries and has a strong economy that gives its people a high standard of living. The government helps the economy grow, but businesses are free to make their own decisions. Compared to North Korea, South Korea is much richer and more connected to the world.

China's economy is also very different from North Korea's. China has a mix of state-owned and private businesses. It's the world's second-largest economy and makes a lot of things that people around the world buy, like electronics and clothes. China trades a lot with other countries and has a big impact on the global economy. While the Chinese government has a lot of control over the economy, it's still much more open and dynamic than North Korea's. People in China generally have more access to goods and services than people in North Korea.

## What role does international trade play in North Korea's economy?

International trade plays a small but important role in North Korea's economy. The country doesn't trade a lot with the rest of the world because it is isolated and faces many restrictions. These restrictions come from other countries that don't want North Korea to have certain things, like weapons. But, North Korea still tries to trade with a few countries, like China and Russia. They trade things like minerals, seafood, and textiles to get money and other things they need, like food and medicine.

Even though international trade is limited, it's still very important for North Korea. The country needs to get things from outside because it can't make everything it needs on its own. For example, they might trade coal for food or medicine. Without this trade, life would be even harder for people in North Korea. But, because of the restrictions and the small amount of trade, it's a challenge for the country to get enough of what it needs.

## How have international sanctions affected the North Korean Won and the broader economy?

International sanctions have made life harder for people in North Korea and have affected their money, the North Korean Won. Sanctions are rules that other countries put on North Korea to stop them from doing things like making weapons. Because of these rules, North Korea can't trade as much with other countries. This means they can't sell things like coal and seafood, which they need to buy food and medicine. When they can't trade, the value of the North Korean Won goes down in the unofficial market. People in North Korea need more Won to buy things from other countries, which makes life even harder for them.

The broader economy in North Korea also feels the impact of these sanctions. Because the country can't trade as much, they don't have as much money to spend on things their people need. This can lead to shortages of food and medicine, making it hard for people to live healthy lives. The government tries to control everything, including the money, but the sanctions make it harder for them to keep things running smoothly. Overall, the sanctions put a lot of pressure on North Korea's economy and the everyday lives of its people.

## What are the economic reforms North Korea has attempted in recent years?

In recent years, North Korea has tried to make some changes to its economy to make life better for its people. One big change was letting people start their own small businesses in special markets. These markets are places where people can buy and sell things more freely than before. The government also tried to make factories and farms work better by giving them more freedom to decide what to make and sell. These changes were meant to help the country make more money and get more things that people need, like food and medicine.

But, these changes have been hard to make work well. The government still controls a lot of the economy and can change the rules whenever they want. This makes it hard for businesses to plan for the future. Also, because of the international sanctions, North Korea can't trade as much with other countries. This means they can't get as much money or things they need from outside. So, even though the government tried to make some changes, the economy is still facing a lot of challenges.

## How does the informal economy operate within North Korea?

The informal economy in North Korea is a big part of how people get by every day. It's made up of markets where people can buy and sell things without the government telling them exactly what to do. These markets are called "jangmadang." People sell things like food, clothes, and even things they make at home. It's important because the official stores, which are run by the government, often don't have enough of what people need. So, people turn to these markets to find things to eat and use.

Even though the government tries to control everything, they let these markets happen because they know people need them. But, the government can still change the rules about what can be sold and how much it costs. This makes it hard for people who work in the markets because they never know if the rules will change. Still, the informal economy helps a lot of people in North Korea get the things they need to live, even if it's not always easy.

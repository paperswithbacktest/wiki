## How has AIG's stock performed over the past decade?

Over the past decade, AIG's stock has had its ups and downs. In 2013, the stock was trading at around $50 per share. It saw a high of about $65 in 2017, but then it dropped to around $25 in early 2020 because of the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

This reflects the challenges and changes AIG faced during the decade, including restructuring efforts and shifts in the global insurance market.

## What was the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on AIG?

The 2008 financial crisis hit AIG really hard. The company was in big trouble because it had made a lot of risky bets, especially with something called credit default swaps. These were like insurance policies for other companies' debts. When the housing market crashed, AIG had to pay out huge amounts of money, and it couldn't afford it. This led to AIG needing a massive bailout from the U.S. government, which gave the company about $182 billion to stay afloat. Without this help, AIG might have gone bankrupt.

After the crisis, AIG had to change a lot. The company sold off many of its businesses and focused on its core insurance operations. It also worked hard to pay back the money it got from the government. By 2012, AIG had repaid most of the bailout funds, and it continued to recover over the years. The 2008 crisis was a tough lesson for AIG, showing the dangers of risky financial practices and the importance of sticking to what a company does best.

## How has AIG restructured its business following the financial crisis?

After the 2008 financial crisis, AIG had to make big changes to stay in business. The company sold off many parts of its business that were not its main focus, like its aircraft leasing and consumer finance units. By doing this, AIG could concentrate on what it does best: insurance. They also got rid of their risky financial products, like credit default swaps, which had caused so many problems during the crisis. This helped AIG become a more stable and focused company.

AIG also worked hard to pay back the money it borrowed from the government during the bailout. By 2012, they had repaid most of it, which was a big step in rebuilding trust with investors and the public. Over time, AIG kept improving its core insurance business, making it stronger and more efficient. They also started new programs to help manage risks better and serve their customers more effectively. These changes helped AIG recover and grow stronger after the crisis.

## What are AIG's current strategic priorities?

AIG's main goal right now is to keep making their insurance business even better. They want to focus on selling more life and property insurance, which are the things they do best.

This way, they can offer good prices and still make a profit.

Another important thing for AIG is to grow in new places around the world. They want to reach more people and businesses in different countries. AIG is also looking at new ways to help customers manage risks, like offering special insurance plans for different industries. By doing all these things, AIG hopes to keep getting stronger and be a leader in the insurance world for a long time.

## Who are the major competitors of AIG in the insurance industry?

AIG has many big competitors in the insurance world. Some of the main ones are companies like Allianz, AXA, and Prudential Financial. These companies are all over the world and offer similar insurance products, like life insurance, car insurance, and business insurance. They are always trying to get more customers and offer better deals, so AIG has to work hard to stay ahead.

In the United States, AIG also competes with companies like State Farm, GEICO, and Liberty Mutual. These companies are very popular and have a lot of customers. They focus a lot on car and home insurance, which are important parts of AIG's business too. So, AIG needs to keep improving its services and prices to keep up with these competitors.

Overall, AIG faces strong competition from many different companies, both at home and around the world. To stay successful, AIG needs to keep offering good products and services, and find ways to stand out from the crowd.

## What is AIG's approach to risk management?

AIG's approach to risk management is all about being careful and smart. They use special teams and computer programs to keep an eye on risks. These teams look at everything that could go wrong, like natural disasters, accidents, or even changes in the economy. By understanding these risks, AIG can make plans to avoid big problems. They also use something called "risk modeling" to guess what might happen and how bad it could be. This helps them decide how much to charge for insurance and how much money to keep aside for emergencies.

AIG also helps their customers manage risks. They offer advice and special insurance plans that fit different needs. For example, they might help a business plan for things like fires or lawsuits. AIG works closely with their customers to make sure they understand their risks and have the right protection. By doing this, AIG not only protects their own business but also helps their customers feel safe and secure.

    def __init__(self, insured_event, payout_amount):
        self.insured_event = insured_event
        self.payout_amount = payout_amount
        self.claim_processed = False

    def check_event(self, event_data):
        if event_data == self.insured_event:
            self.process_claim()

    def process_claim(self):
        if not self.claim_processed:
            self.transfer_funds(self.payout_amount)
            self.claim_processed = True

    def transfer_funds(self, amount):
        # Logic to transfer funds
        pass
```

This contract checks whether an insured event matches the logged event data and processes the corresponding claim, ensuring a swift and fair settlement.

Moreover, blockchain technology assures transparency and fairness in setting insurance rates. The immutable ledger records all transactions and associated data, providing an open and verifiable history that both insurers and customers can trust.

Traditional payment systems often involve multiple intermediaries, each adding a layer of complexity and potential points of failure. Blockchain eliminates many of these middlemen, leading to more efficient transaction processing.

A practical implementation could be the use of blockchain for automatic fuel payments. A car equipped with a digital wallet and a smart contract can trigger a payment transaction as soon as it refuels. Suppose the fuel cost is $X, and the user's wallet balance is $Y. The smart contract could be structured as follows in Python pseudocode:

```python
def fuel_payment(cost, wallet_balance):
    if wallet_balance >= cost:
        wallet_balance -= cost
        print("Payment successful. Remaining balance:", wallet_balance)
        return True
    else:
        print("Insufficient balance. Payment failed.")
        return False

# Example Usage
cost_of_fuel = 50  # For example, $50
current_balance = 100  # User's current wallet balance

fuel_payment(cost_of_fuel, current_balance)
```

In addition to operational efficiencies, blockchain enhances security through its decentralized nature.

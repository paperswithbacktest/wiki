Andrew's idea has changed how people think about the stock market and how they make decisions about money.

Another big contribution Andrew made is in the area of quantitative finance. He helped create new ways to use math and computers to understand the stock market better. This is called "[algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading)." It uses special math formulas to decide when to buy or sell stocks. Andrew's work has helped make trading faster and more accurate. Many big companies use these methods now to manage their money.

Andrew also started a company called AlphaSimplex Group. This company uses his ideas to help people make better choices with their money.

## What is the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis and how did Andrew Lo contribute to it?

The Adaptive Markets Hypothesis is an idea that Andrew Lo came up with to explain how the stock market works. It says that people in the market don't always make perfect decisions.

Andrew's idea is different from older ideas that said the market always acts in a predictable way.

Andrew Lo contributed to the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis by studying how people's behaviors affect the stock market. He used his knowledge of economics and math to show that people learn and adapt, which impacts how the market moves. His work has helped people understand that the stock market isn't just about numbers, but also about human behavior. This new way of thinking has changed how people make decisions about money and has made Andrew's ideas very important in the world of finance.

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Example data of market indicators and property prices
market_indicators = np.array([[5, 2], [10, 3], [15, 5], [20, 7]])
property_prices = np.array([200, 250, 300, 350])

# Linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(market_indicators, property_prices)

# Predicting prices based on new indicators
new_indicators = np.array([[25, 8]])
predicted_prices = model.predict(new_indicators)

print("Predicted Property Prices:", predicted_prices)
```

This code snippet demonstrates a straightforward approach to predicting property prices based on market indicators using a linear regression model.

## Can you explain the clearing and settlement process on Nodal Exchange?

When you trade on Nodal Exchange, the clearing and settlement process makes sure your trades are safe and final. After you make a trade, it goes to Nodal Clear, which is the company that owns Nodal Exchange. Nodal Clear acts like a middleman between the people buying and selling energy. They make sure that both sides of the trade follow through on their promises. This means that if you buy energy, you'll get it, and if you sell energy, you'll get paid. Nodal Clear does this by keeping track of all the trades and making sure everyone has enough money or energy to complete them.

The settlement part happens after the trade is cleared. This is when the actual exchange of energy or money happens. If you bought energy, Nodal Clear makes sure you get the energy you need at the right time and place. If you sold energy, they make sure you get paid for it.

## How does Nodal Exchange handle risk management?

Nodal Exchange helps manage risk by using a company called Nodal Clear. Nodal Clear acts like a middleman in all trades, making sure that both the buyer and the seller follow through on their promises. If someone can't pay or deliver the energy they promised, Nodal Clear steps in to make sure the trade still happens. This is called being a central counterparty, and it helps protect everyone from losing money or energy if something goes wrong.

The exchange also uses something called margin requirements to manage risk. Before you can trade, you have to put some money into your account as a kind of promise that you'll be able to complete your trades. This money is called margin. If the price of energy changes a lot and you might not be able to finish your trade, Nodal Exchange can use your margin to cover the difference. This helps make sure that everyone can trust that their trades will be safe and that the market stays stable.

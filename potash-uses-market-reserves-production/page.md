# Example: Calculate RSI and generate buy/sell signals based on threshold
def trading_signal(data, window=14, buy_threshold=30, sell_threshold=70):
    rsi = RSIIndicator(data['close'], window=window).rsi()
    data['signal'] = 0
    data.loc[rsi < buy_threshold, 'signal'] = 1  # Buy signal
    data.loc[rsi > sell_threshold, 'signal'] = -1 # Sell signal
    return data

# Sample data frame using stock close prices
data = pd.DataFrame({'close': np.random.uniform(low=50, high=150, size=100)})

# Generate trading signals
signals = trading_signal(data)

print(signals)
```

In summary, algorithmic trading offers a robust framework for executing trades swiftly and with precision, thus becoming an integral component of modern financial markets and commodities trading.

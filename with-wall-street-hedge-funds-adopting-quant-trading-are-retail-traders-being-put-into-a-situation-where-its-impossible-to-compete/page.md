The adoption of quantitative trading by Wall Street's major hedge funds has certainly increased competition on the financial markets. Retail traders face several challenges in this context:

1. **Access to Data**: Large hedge funds have access to extensive and costly databases, as well as to alternative data sources that are difficult for retail traders to obtain.
2. **Computational power**: Institutional funds have access to advanced technological resources, enabling them to analyze large volumes of data at high speed, and to execute orders almost instantaneously.
3. **Research and development**: Hedge funds can invest heavily in research and develop advanced strategies with teams of highly qualified professionals.
4. **Economies of scale**: Large funds benefit from economies of scale that can reduce their transaction costs and give them access to opportunities reserved for large investors.
5. **Regulation**: Certain markets or financial instruments may be less accessible to individual traders due to regulatory restrictions.

However, this does not necessarily mean that retail traders cannot succeed or are in a situation where it is impossible to compete:

1. **Flexibility**: Retail traders can be more agile and adapt more quickly to market changes than larger funds, which sometimes have massive positions to manage.
2. **Niche**: Retail traders can focus on specific market segments or less common strategies that the big players might overlook.
3. **Technological innovation**: With the increasing accessibility of technological and educational tools, retail traders now have access to resources previously reserved for professionals.
4. **Fewer Constraints**: Retail traders can have fewer constraints in terms of investment mandates, allowing them to explore diversified strategies.

In conclusion, although the advent of quantitative trading has changed the competitive landscape and posed new challenges for retail traders, opportunities remain. The key for retail traders is to continue educating themselves, adapting their strategies, and using the tools and technologies available to maximize their competitive advantages.

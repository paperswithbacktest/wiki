## What is the Official Cash Rate and how does it influence the economy?

The Official Cash Rate (OCR) is the interest rate set by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. It's the rate that banks use when they borrow money from each other overnight. When the Reserve Bank changes the OCR, it affects other interest rates in the economy, like the rates people pay on loans and the rates they get on their savings. If the OCR goes up, borrowing money becomes more expensive, which can slow down spending and help control inflation. If the OCR goes down, borrowing becomes cheaper, which can encourage people to spend more and help boost the economy.

The OCR influences the economy by helping to keep things balanced. When the Reserve Bank sees that prices are going up too fast (inflation), they might raise the OCR to make borrowing more expensive. This can slow down spending and help keep prices from rising too quickly. On the other hand, if the economy is not doing well and people are not spending enough, the Reserve Bank might lower the OCR to make borrowing cheaper. This can encourage people to spend more, which can help the economy grow. By adjusting the OCR, the Reserve Bank tries to keep the economy stable and the value of the New Zealand dollar steady.

## How does the Reserve Bank of New Zealand handle foreign reserves?

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand keeps foreign reserves to help manage the country's money and make sure the economy stays stable. Foreign reserves are like savings in other countries' money, like US dollars or Euros. The bank uses these reserves to buy and sell foreign currency when they need to. This helps them keep the New Zealand dollar's value steady and makes it easier for businesses and people to trade with other countries.

When the Reserve Bank sees that the New Zealand dollar is getting too strong or too weak, they might use their foreign reserves to help balance it out. For example, if the dollar is too weak, they might sell some of their foreign reserves to buy New Zealand dollars. This can help make the dollar stronger. On the other hand, if the dollar is too strong, they might buy foreign currency with their reserves, which can help make the New Zealand dollar weaker. By doing this, the Reserve Bank helps keep the economy running smoothly and makes sure people can trust the value of their money.

## What is the Candle Makers' Petition?

The Candle Makers' Petition is a famous piece of writing by Frédéric Bastiat, a French economist. It was written in 1845 as a way to make fun of people who wanted to protect their businesses by stopping foreign competition. In the petition, Bastiat pretends to be candle makers who are asking the government to block out the sun. They say that if the sun is blocked, people will have to buy more candles, which will help the candle makers' business.

Bastiat uses this funny idea to show how silly it is to try to protect one group of people by hurting everyone else. He argues that blocking out the sun would make life worse for everyone, just like protecting one industry can harm the whole economy. By using humor, Bastiat helps people see the problems with protectionism, which is when governments help certain businesses by limiting competition.

The funny story about blocking out the sun helps people see how silly it is to try to help one group by hurting everyone else.

## What are some critiques of the arguments made in the Candle Makers' Petition?

Some people think the Candle Makers' Petition is too simple. They say that Bastiat makes fun of protectionism, but real life is more complicated. They believe that sometimes, protecting local businesses can help a country grow stronger. For example, if a new industry needs time to get started, a little help from the government might be good. These people think that Bastiat's funny story about blocking out the sun doesn't show all the ways protectionism can be useful.

Others say that the petition doesn't talk about all the good things that can come from protecting local businesses. They argue that helping local industries can create jobs and keep money in the country. They think that Bastiat's focus on free trade might not be the best for everyone, especially if a country is trying to build up its own businesses. While the petition is good at making people laugh and think, these critics believe it doesn't give a full picture of the pros and cons of protectionism.

## How does the Candle Makers' Petition illustrate the concept of opportunity cost in economics?

The Candle Makers' Petition shows the idea of opportunity cost by making fun of what happens when you block out the sun. Opportunity cost is what you give up when you choose to do one thing instead of another. In the petition, the candle makers want the government to block out the sun so people will buy more candles. But if the sun is blocked, people lose the free light and warmth it gives. This means the cost of blocking the sun is losing all the good things the sun does for free.

Bastiat uses this funny story to show that protecting one group, like candle makers, can make everyone else worse off. By choosing to help the candle makers, the country would lose the benefits of the sun. This is a big opportunity cost because the sun's light and warmth are very valuable. Bastiat's petition helps people see that when the government tries to protect one industry, it can hurt the whole economy by making everyone give up something important.

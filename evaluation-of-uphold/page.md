## How does Uphold comply with regulatory requirements in different countries?

Uphold works hard to follow the rules in different countries where it operates. They know that each place has its own laws about money and cryptocurrencies, so they make sure to get the right licenses and follow the local rules. For example, in the United States, Uphold is registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a Money Services Business. This means they have to do things like check who their customers are and report any suspicious activity to help stop crime.

In other countries, Uphold does similar things to make sure they are following the local laws. They work with regulators and sometimes change how they do things to meet the different rules. This can include things like keeping customer money safe, protecting user data, and making sure they are clear about fees and services. By doing this, Uphold tries to build trust with its users and the places where it operates.

## What are the limitations or cons of using Uphold for advanced trading strategies?

Uphold is great for simple trading, but it might not be the best for people who want to do advanced trading. One big limitation is that Uphold doesn't have many advanced tools. For example, they don't have things like stop-loss orders, which let you set a price to sell your cryptocurrency if it drops too low. They also don't have margin trading, where you can borrow money to trade more than you have. These tools are important for people who want to do more complex trading strategies.

Another thing is that Uphold's fees can add up if you're doing a lot of trades. Even though their fees are low compared to some places, they can still affect your profits if you're trading a lot. Also, Uphold might not have all the cryptocurrencies you want to trade. They have a good selection, but if you're into very new or less common cryptocurrencies, you might not find them on Uphold. So, if you're an advanced trader looking for more options and tools, you might want to look at other platforms too.

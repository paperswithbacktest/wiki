labels = data['Price_Movement']  # dependent variable (e.g., 'Up', 'Down')

# Split dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a RandomForest model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate the model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Fit the model with training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

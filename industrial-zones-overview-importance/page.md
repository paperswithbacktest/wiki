# Example of a moving average crossover strategy
def moving_average_crossover(data, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Compute short and long moving averages
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Create buy/sell signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
    return signals

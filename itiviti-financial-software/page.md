## The Evolution of Itiviti

Itiviti's inception in 2016 resulted from the strategic merger of two prominent trading technology enterprises: Orc Group and CameronTec.

The union of these two companies was motivated by the pressing need to accommodate increasingly stringent regulatory frameworks and to offer a more integrated trading infrastructure.

The fusion of Orc Group and CameronTec created a comprehensive suite of tools designed to meet the complex requirements of the modern trading ecosystem. By merging their expertise, the newly formed Itiviti was well-positioned to provide an end-to-end solution that enhanced trading performance and facilitated regulatory compliance. Its robust technology stack enabled financial institutions to navigate rapidly evolving market conditions and regulatory landscapes.

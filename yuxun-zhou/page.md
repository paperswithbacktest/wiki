## Early Life and Education

Yuxun Zhou was born in China and demonstrated an early aptitude for mathematics and science, which set the foundation for a distinguished career in quantitative research and algorithmic trading. Zhou pursued his undergraduate studies at Xi'an Jiaotong University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 2009. His academic journey then took him to France, where he attended École Centrale Paris, earning a Diplôme d'Ingénieur in Applied Mathematics in 2011.

These formative years equipped Zhou with a robust understanding of mathematical principles and engineering, further enhancing his analytical prowess. His time at École Centrale Paris provided him with the opportunity to hone his fluency in French, adding to his multilingual capabilities in English and Chinese.

Zhou's educational path culminated at the University of California, Berkeley, where he pursued a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from 2012 to 2017. During his time at UC Berkeley, Zhou engaged in a diverse array of research topics, including statistical learning theory, causal analysis, learning with geometric constraints, event detection in data streams, inverse game theory, and optimization methods in machine learning.

## Research and Academic Contributions

As a Graduate Student Researcher at UC Berkeley, Zhou made significant contributions to the field of machine learning and statistical analysis. His research was centered on the intersection of theoretical development and practical application, with a focus on how learning algorithms can be structured to make accurate predictions from incomplete data.

Among his notable academic endeavors, Zhou was a Graduate Student Instructor for the course CS281A/Stat241a: Statistical Learning Theory, a graduate-level class that delved into machine learning and graphical models. His involvement in teaching broadened his understanding of these subjects while simultaneously impacting budding researchers by guiding them through complex theoretical concepts.

Zhou’s work resulted in several key publications that include:
- "Data-driven event detection with partial knowledge: A hidden structure semi-supervised learning method"
- "Veto-consensus multiple kernel learning"
- "Virtual power sensing based on a multiple-hypotheses sequential test"
- "Online Learning for Contextual Hidden Markov Model"
- "Building chiller system fault detection and diagnosis with a hierarchical learning method"

These publications highlighted his innovative approach to problems in data analysis, particularly in handling incomplete data sets and optimizing [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning) processes.

## Professional Career

Yuxun Zhou’s career in quantitative research began immediately after his time at UC Berkeley. He briefly served as a Research Associate within UC Berkeley’s College of Engineering, where he continued to develop his expertise in engineering and computer sciences.

Zhou then joined Citadel Securities in Chicago as a Quantitative Researcher from July 2017 to December 2021. During his tenure at Citadel, Zhou applied his extensive knowledge of statistical learning and data-driven analysis to develop strategies in equities trading. Citadel Securities is renowned for its cutting-edge [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading) strategies, a field to which Zhou significantly contributed through his quantitative research.

Since January 2022, Zhou has been part of Jump Trading LLC, a proprietary trading firm based in Berkeley, California. At Jump Trading, Zhou's role as a Quantitative Researcher involves developing and implementing algorithmic trading models, contributing to the company's competitive edge in high-frequency trading ([HFT](/wiki/high-frequency-trading-strategies)). His work is instrumental in leveraging machine learning systems to predict market movements and enhance trading efficiency.

## Skills and Expertise

Throughout his career, Zhou has continually expanded his expertise in the domains of equity research, machine learning, and data analysis. His proficiency in these areas is fortified by his multilingual capabilities in English, French, and Chinese, allowing him to collaborate effectively across diverse teams and global markets.

Zhou’s understanding of machine learning algorithms, combined with his practical experience in high-stakes financial environments, positions him as a leading figure in the development of AI-driven trading strategies. His work often intersects with key scientific literature in the field, drawing from publications such as "Algorithmic Trading and DMA" by Barry Johnson and "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Marcos Lopez de Prado, which have defined many of the cutting-edge practices in [quantitative trading](/wiki/quantitative-trading) and machine learning applications in finance.

## External Engagements

Beyond his core professional responsibilities, Zhou maintains an active engagement with the academic and professional communities through platforms such as LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/yuxun-zhou-2b8a1255). This engagement not only allows him to keep abreast of the latest technological advancements and industry trends but also enables him to share insights from his own research and professional experiences.

Yuxun Zhou remains a prominent figure in the field of algorithmic trading, continually pushing the boundaries of how data-driven approaches can be utilized in financial markets. His blend of academic rigor and practical application underscores his significant impact in the world of quantitative trading.

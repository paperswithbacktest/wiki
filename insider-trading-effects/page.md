**Insider trading** refers to the practice of trading stocks or other securities by individuals with access to non-public information relevant to the price of those securities. In this article, we will explore in depth the effects of insider trading, particularly in the context of **algorithmic trading** or "algo trading".

## What is insider trading?

Insider trading refers to transactions carried out by individuals who possess non-public information about a company. While these transactions are legal if properly reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), they are illegal when based on information that has not yet been made public.

### Key points

- Insider trading is the buying or selling of a share in a listed company by a person with access to relevant non-public information about that company.
- Non-public information is any information that could substantially influence an investor's decision to buy or sell a security, and which has not been made public.
- Insider trading is illegal when based on non-public information, and can result in fines and prison sentences.

## Why is insider trading controversial?

Insider trading is often seen as having an unfair advantage in the market. Insiders, thanks to their inside information, can make substantial profits, leaving ordinary investors behind. However, some believe that the insider trading book may contain information that the market has not yet fully assimilated. This hypothesis led to the development of the **insider effect trading strategy**.

## Insider effect trading: a viable strategy?

According to some studies based on US data, insiders are indeed better informed and achieve abnormal returns. However, implementing investment strategies based on insider trading is not straightforward. Only insider buying seems to be useful, while selling is not associated with low returns.

## Insider inaction: a potential signal?

Insider inaction suggests a relationship between regulatory silence and often negative future returns. For example, insiders of merger targets refrain from buying in the months preceding the merger announcement. Similarly, insiders of bankrupt companies refrain from selling before the bankruptcy filing.

## Insider trading and algo trading

With the rise of **algo trading**, traders are looking to use the effect of insider trading to optimize their strategies. By combining the insider trading effect with other market phenomena, such as stock momentum or short-selling information, it is possible to create more robust forecasts and maximize returns.

## Compliance and legality

It is essential to comply with the rules established by the SEC when conducting or analyzing insider trading. Penalties for illegal insider trading can be severe, and all traders, whether individuals or professional algo traders, must be aware of the legal implications of their actions.

## Conclusion

Insider trading is a complex field that offers both opportunities and challenges for traders. Although controversial, there is evidence to suggest that insiders can have an advantage in the market. However, with technological advances and the evolution of algorithmic trading, it is possible to use this information to create more effective and balanced trading strategies. It is essential to always act legally and ethically to ensure the confidence and integrity of the financial market.

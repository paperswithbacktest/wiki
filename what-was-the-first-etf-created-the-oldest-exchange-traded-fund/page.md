```python
import numpy as np

class TradingEnv:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.n = len(data)
        self.current_step = 0

    def reset(self):
        self.current_step = 0
        return self.data[self.current_step]

    def step(self, action):
        reward = action * (self.data[self.current_step + 1] - self.data[self.current_step])
        self.current_step += 1
        next_state = self.data[self.current_step] if self.current_step < self.n - 1 else None
        done = self.current_step >= self.n - 1
        return next_state, reward, done

def train(env, episodes):
    for episode in range(episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        while not done:
            action = np.random.choice([-1, 0, 1])  # Simplistic action: sell, hold, buy
            next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
            # Implement learning algorithm here

# Example usage
price_data = np.random.randn(100)  # random price changes
env = TradingEnv(price_data)
train(env, 100)
```

Despite the promise of these advancements, there are challenges to consider. Market volatility and unpredictability can still undermine algorithmic predictions, and AI systems require continuous monitoring to prevent drift or overfitting.

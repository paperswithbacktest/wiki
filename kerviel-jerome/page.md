## What were the trading strategies used by Jérôme Kerviel?

Jérôme Kerviel used a trading strategy called "futures" to make his secret trades. Futures are agreements to buy or sell something at a set price in the future. Kerviel made big bets on the stock market using these futures. He thought he could make a lot of money for the bank if the market went the way he expected. But he was not allowed to make such big trades, so he hid them by making fake records and pretending they were small trades that were okay.

Kerviel also used a strategy called "[arbitrage](/wiki/arbitrage)." This means he tried to make money by taking advantage of small differences in prices between different markets. He would buy something in one market and sell it in another market at a slightly higher price. But Kerviel did this on a huge scale, much bigger than he was allowed to. He hid these trades too, making it look like he was following the rules when he was not. These risky strategies led to huge losses for Société Générale when they did not work out.

## How did Jérôme Kerviel manage to hide his unauthorized trades?

Jérôme Kerviel managed to hide his unauthorized trades by using fake records and pretending that everything was okay.

He also used other people's computer accounts to make his trades, so it was hard for the bank to see that it was him doing it. Kerviel was smart about how he hid his trades. He knew the bank's systems well because he used to work in the part of the bank that checked trades. So, he knew how to trick the system and make his big trades look like they were small and allowed.

Kerviel also used a strategy called "back-to-back" trades. This means he made two trades at the same time, one to buy and one to sell, so it looked like he was not taking any risk. But really, these trades were very risky because they were so big. He made these trades look like they canceled each other out, but they did not. This way, he could hide the big risks he was taking from the bank. By using all these tricks, Kerviel was able to hide his secret trades for a long time before the bank found out.

They wanted to make sure that no one could hide big trades like Kerviel did.

## What are the lessons learned from the Jérôme Kerviel case in terms of risk management and regulatory oversight?

The Jérôme Kerviel case taught the financial industry a lot about risk management. It showed that even a junior trader could cause huge problems if they were not watched closely enough. Banks learned that they needed better systems to check on what their traders were doing. They started using new tools and rules to make sure big trades could not be hidden. This helped make the banks safer and less likely to lose a lot of money because of one person's actions.

The case also made people think more about regulatory oversight. It showed that the rules in place were not strong enough to stop someone like Kerviel from making secret trades. Governments and financial watchdogs started making new laws to make sure banks had to follow stricter rules.

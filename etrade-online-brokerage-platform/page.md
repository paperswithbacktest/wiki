Overall, E*TRADE is a strong choice for both new and experienced investors who want a balance of easy-to-use tools, educational resources, and advanced trading options.

## What security measures does E*TRADE implement to protect user data and investments?

Another way E*TRADE keeps your account safe is by offering two-[factor](/wiki/factor-investing) authentication. This means you need more than just a password to log in. You might need to enter a special code sent to your phone, which makes it much harder for someone else to get into your account. E*TRADE also has insurance to protect your money if something goes wrong. They are part of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which can help cover your investments up to certain limits if the company faces financial trouble. All these measures help make sure your money and information stay safe with E*TRADE.

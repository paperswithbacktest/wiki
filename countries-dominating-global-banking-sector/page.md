For instance, popular programming languages such as Python enable traders to develop, backtest, and deploy algorithms efficiently. A basic strategy can be implemented using libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and SciKit-learn for [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning):

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Example: Simple linear regression for predicting stock prices
data = pd.read_csv('stock_prices.csv')
features = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
target = data['target_price']

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(features, target)

# Predict prices
predictions = model.predict(features)
```

Algorithmic trading's impact on market dynamics is profound. It enhances market efficiency by reducing bid-ask spreads and providing continuous liquidity.

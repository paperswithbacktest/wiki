## What advanced trading strategies can be used on the Cboe Futures Exchange?

One advanced trading strategy on the Cboe Futures Exchange is called "straddles." This involves buying both a call option and a put option on the VIX at the same time, with the same strike price and expiration date. You do this when you think the market is going to move a lot, but you're not sure which way. If the VIX goes up a lot, the call option will make money. If it goes down a lot, the put option will make money. This strategy can help you make money from big moves in either direction, but it also costs more because you're buying two options.

Another strategy is "calendar spreads." With this, you buy and sell futures contracts on the VIX that have different expiration dates. For example, you might buy a VIX future that expires in one month and sell a VIX future that expires in three months. This strategy works well if you think the short-term VIX will be different from the long-term VIX. If the short-term VIX goes up more than the long-term VIX, you can make money. This can be a good way to bet on how the market's expectations of volatility will change over time.

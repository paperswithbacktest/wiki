## What are Stock Analysis Techniques?

Stock analysis is a crucial component in crafting effective investment strategies by evaluating historical data, market trends, and financial statements. Two primary methods of stock analysis are technical analysis and [fundamental analysis](/wiki/fundamental-analysis).

Technical analysis focuses on the statistical analysis of market activity, including price movement and [volume](/wiki/volume-trading-strategy). It operates on the principle that past trading activity and price changes can be valuable indicators of future price movement. Technical analysts use various tools to aid their analysis, including:

- **Chart Patterns**: These are specific formations created by the movement of stock prices on a chart. Common patterns include Head and Shoulders, Flags, and Pennants. These patterns signal potential reversals or continuations in trends.

- **Indicators**: Indicators are mathematical calculations based on historical price and volume data. Some of the most widely used technical indicators include Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).

For example, a simple Python code to calculate a Moving Average might look like this:

```python
def moving_average(data, period):
    return [sum(data[i:i+period])/period for i in range(len(data)-period+1)]
```

Fundamental analysis, on the other hand, involves examining a company's financial health. This evaluation includes scrutinizing financial statements, understanding management quality, assessing competitive advantages, and considering the company's position in the market. Key aspects of fundamental analysis include:

- **Revenue and Earnings**: Analysts look at a company’s revenue growth over time and its earnings per share (EPS) to determine profitability trends.

- **Valuation Ratios**: Ratios like the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Return on Equity (ROE), and Debt-to-Equity (D/E) ratio provide insight into a company’s value and financial health relative to its peers.

For instance, the P/E ratio is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Value per Share}}{\text{Earnings per Share (EPS)}}
$$

Both technical and fundamental analyses provide insights that can guide investment decisions. While technical analysis is often used for short-term trading strategies, fundamental analysis is more typically employed for long-term investment decisions. A well-rounded investor might apply both approaches to benefit from a holistic view of the market and specific securities.

To illustrate a simple example of algorithmic trading, consider a moving average crossover strategy. This can be implemented in Python as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'data' is a DataFrame with stock prices
data['SMA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()  # 50-day simple moving average
data['SMA200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean() # 200-day simple moving average

def generate_signals(data):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    signals['signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA50'][50:] > data['SMA200'][50:], 1.0, 0.0)    
    signals['position'] = signals['signal'].diff()
    return signals

signals = generate_signals(data)
```

In the script above, a trading signal is generated when a short-term moving average (SMA50) crosses above a long-term moving average (SMA200), indicating a potential buy opportunity. Such simple strategies have evolved into more complex models incorporating real-time data analytics, [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning), and big data technologies.

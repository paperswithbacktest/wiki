## What are the main services provided by Optiver?

Having offices in different countries helps Optiver to trade at all times of the day. This is because when it's night in one place, it might be daytime in another. So, they can keep trading no matter where the sun is.

## How does Optiver contribute to market liquidity?

Optiver helps make markets more liquid by being a market maker. This means they are always ready to buy and sell things like stocks and options. When they do this, it's easier for other people to trade because there's always someone on the other side of the deal. This makes the market more active and helps prices stay fair. If there's more trading happening, it's easier for everyone to buy and sell what they need.

They use special computer programs to do this quickly and efficiently. These programs help Optiver see what's happening in the market and make decisions fast. By being fast and ready to trade, Optiver adds to the number of trades happening. More trades mean the market is more liquid, which is good for everyone who wants to trade.

import pandas as pd

def moving_average_strategy(data, short_window=40, long_window=100):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Short moving average
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()

    # Long moving average
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

    # Generate signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Example usage with market data
# market_data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)
# signals = moving_average_strategy(market_data)
```

This code snippet demonstrates a straightforward strategy using short and long-term moving averages to generate buy or sell signals. Such strategies can be the foundation for more sophisticated systems that incorporate additional market indicators and machine learning predictions.

Overall, algorithmic trading has revolutionized financial markets by enabling traders to make data-driven decisions with unprecedented speed and precision.

import json

def process_delivery_notice(notice):
    # Simulate processing a delivery notice
    print("Processing delivery notice...")
    data = json.loads(notice)
    update_inventory(data['commodity'], data['quantity'])
    notify_stakeholders(data)

def update_inventory(commodity, quantity):
    # Placeholder function to update inventory system
    print(f"Updating inventory: {commodity}, Quantity: {quantity}")

def notify_stakeholders(data):
    # Placeholder function to notify stakeholders
    print(f"Notifying stakeholders about delivery of {data['commodity']} on {data['delivery_date']} to {data['location']}")
```

In summary, delivery notices are indispensable in the logistics and commodities trading sectors.

## History of Susquehanna International Group

Susquehanna International Group (SIG) was founded by six college friends who met in the late 1970s at SUNY Binghamton. The group, which included Jeffrey S. Yass, employed skills honed through playing poker as an innovative approach to decision-making in trading. They leveraged principles of poker and game theory to develop strategies that emphasized skillful risk assessment and probabilistic thinking.

Established in 1987, SIG emerged during a transformative period for financial markets. This era saw significant technological advancements and regulatory changes that paved the way for modern trading practices. The same year proved challenging with the occurrence of Black Monday, a global stock market crash. SIG not only survived this turbulent period but also established a foothold in the competitive trading industry. The firm's founders attributed their resilience to the strategic insights derived from game theory, allowing them to navigate the volatile market landscape effectively.

The principles of poker — including understanding odds, managing risk, and recognizing patterns — were seamlessly integrated into SIG's trading ethos. This unique foundation has contributed significantly to SIG's sustained success and growth, differentiating it from other firms in the highly competitive financial trading sector.

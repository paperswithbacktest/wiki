   data['returns'] = data['Close'].pct_change()

   # Calculate momentum indicator
   window = 20
   data['momentum'] = data['returns'].rolling(window=window).mean()

   # Generate trading signals
   data['signal'] = np.where(data['momentum'] > 0, 1, -1)

   # Calculate strategy returns
   data['strategy_returns'] = data['signal'].shift(1) * data['returns']
   ```

## Books on Investment Psychology and Behavioral Insights

Investment psychology and behavioral insights are crucial areas within the field of investing, as they provide an understanding of how psychological factors and biases affect decision-making processes. Here, we discuss three pivotal books that offer valuable perspectives on these topics.

1. **'Predictably Irrational' by Dan Ariely**: This book examines the irrational behaviors that often influence financial decisions, challenging the assumption of human rationality in economic theory. Ariely provides a comprehensive analysis of how individuals make consistent errors when making decisions, thus deviating from the expected utility theory. He demonstrates these phenomena through various experiments and examples, revealing the predictability of irrational behavior. For instance, the concept of "anchoring" is highlighted, where initial exposure to a number or figure exerts a powerful influence on subsequent judgments or decisions. Understanding such biases allows investors to refine their strategies and improve decision-making accuracy.

2. **'Behavioral Investing' by James Montier**: Montier’s work incorporates the principles of behavioral finance, focusing on the cognitive biases that consistently hinder investment decisions. It combines empirical research with theoretical insights to offer practical guidance on managing these biases. Montier emphasizes the importance of investor psychology and how it often leads to systematic errors such as overconfidence, herding, and loss aversion. By providing strategies to mitigate these biases, such as developing a disciplined investment process and emphasizing quantitative over qualitative analysis, Montier helps investors align their decisions more closely with rational thought.

3. **'The Laws of Trading' by Agustin Lebron**: This book integrates decision-making principles with practical trading experience, highlighting the impact of human behavior on trading outcomes. Lebron addresses concepts such as risk management, probabilistic thinking, and the psychological barriers that traders must overcome to achieve consistent success. The book investigates into the cognitive processes that can lead to suboptimal trading strategies, offering a framework to create more resilient decision-making structures. Lebron’s insights support the integration of human psychology with quantitative trading techniques, promoting a balanced approach to trading.

By understanding the psychological underpinnings of investing, these books equip readers with tools to recognize and counteract detrimental biases, ultimately fostering more informed and effective investment strategies.

## Understanding Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic trading utilizes computer systems to execute trades based on pre-established criteria, allowing for operations at speeds and frequencies unattainable by human traders. This process involves complex algorithms that analyze market data and execute trades rapidly, minimizing human intervention. The algorithms can assess numerous parameters – such as price, timing, and volume – to optimize trading strategies.

Various strategies define the landscape of algorithmic trading, prominently including market making, arbitrage, and trend-following. Market making involves buying and selling financial instruments to provide liquidity, with the profit derived from the bid-ask spread. Arbitrage exploits price discrepancies in different markets – for instance, by purchasing an undervalued asset and selling it where it is overvalued, ensuring a riskless profit. Trend-following strategies depend on statistical analysis to capitalize on the [momentum](/wiki/momentum) of asset prices.

With the surge of [algorithmic trading](/wiki/algorithmic-trading), the foundation of trading has shifted from merely possessing capital to mastering technology, data analytics, and advanced algorithms. Successful algo trading relies heavily on data-driven insights and state-of-the-art technological frameworks.

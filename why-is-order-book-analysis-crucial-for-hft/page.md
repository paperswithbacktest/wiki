# Simulated order book data
data = {'price': [100.5, 100.6, 100.7], 'volume': [200, 150, 100], 'side': ['bid', 'ask', 'ask']}
order_book = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate weighted average price
weighted_avg_price = np.average(order_book['price'], weights=order_book['volume'])
print(f'Weighted Average Price: {weighted_avg_price}')
```

This simple script illustrates how basic operations can be foundational for more complex systems that HFT firms might employ. Ultimately, the challenges in analyzing order books for HFT require a robust blend of technology, mathematical modeling, and strategic implementation to maintain a competitive edge in fast-moving financial markets.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Example data: features include bid-ask spread, order book imbalance, etc.
X = np.array([[0.01, 0.1, 100], [0.02, 0.15, 150], [0.015, 0.05, 90], ...])
y = np.array([1, 0, 1, ...])  # 1 indicates upward price movement, 0 no movement or downward

# Splitting the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Model training
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Prediction and accuracy
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

This code demonstrates how to apply a Random Forest classifier to predict price movements based on features like bid-ask spread and order book imbalance.

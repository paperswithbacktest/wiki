## Early Life and Education

Andrei Pastor was born and raised in the vicinity of St. Petersburg, Russia. His early fascination with the natural sciences led him to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Physics at Saint Petersburg State University, where he attended from 1991 to 1995. This foundational education set the stage for his long-standing interest in theoretical physics and later financial markets.

Pastor advanced his education at Florida State University, where he embarked on a journey into the complex theories of condensed matter physics. Between 1996 and 2001, he pursued a PhD focused on theoretical condensed matter physics, with particular interest in phenomena such as electron glass and metal-insulator transitions. His scholarly contributions during this period include publications like "Melting of the Electron Glass" and "Glassy behavior of electrons near metal-insulator transitions", which provided insights into the behavior of electrons in different states.

Further honing his analytical skills, Andrei attended the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University, obtaining a Certificate in Computational Finance during 2004–2005. This interdisciplinary program bridged his physics background with finance, equipping him with the quantitative and computational tools required for a successful career in financial markets.

## Career

### Early Career

Andrei Pastor's professional voyage began on the trading floors of financial giants like Bank of America. From December 2001 to October 2008, he served as a Senior Fixed Income Trader, where he was responsible for trading swaps, treasuries, swaptions, and a range of other fixed income derivatives. In this role, Pastor honed his skills in risk valuation and quantitative relative value trading, which would become the cornerstone of his later pursuits in high-frequency and proprietary trading.

### Transition to Quantitative and High-Frequency Trading

Pastor transitioned to Nico Holdings LLC in March 2009, where he took on the role of Fixed Income Portfolio Manager. Over the course of his tenure, which lasted until March 2010, he implemented fixed income RV (relative value) strategies and engaged in treasury basis and behavioral modeling. His ability to integrate quantitative assessments with trading strategies increased his stature in the realm of high-frequency trading (HFT).

Continuing on this path, he joined Buttonwood Group Trading, LLC, in March 2010 as a Fixed Income Portfolio Manager. With a focus on high-frequency trading across multiple asset classes, he predominantly concentrated on fixed income markets.

Putting a new trading strategy into production is always accompanied by challenges and risks. These risks, if not properly managed, can lead to significant losses. Here's a guide to effective risk management when putting a new trading strategy into production.


## Testing in a simulated environment (backtesting)

Before putting a trading strategy into production, it is essential to test it on historical data. This provides an overview of its performance under various past market conditions.

## Real-time trading with limited capital (paper trading)

Before risking significant capital, test the strategy in real time with a limited amount. This offers an assessment of the strategy's performance under current market conditions without exposing large sums.

## Define stop-loss limits

Determine in advance the maximum amount you are prepared to lose for a position or for the strategy as a whole. If this limit is reached, the position must be automatically liquidated to preserve the remaining capital.

## Diversification

Don't invest all your capital in a single strategy. By diversifying your strategies, you spread the risk and reduce the likelihood of big losses if a particular strategy doesn't work.

## Continuous monitoring

Once a strategy is in production, monitor it constantly for deviations from expected performance. Use specialized tools and software to monitor trades in real time.

## Periodic review

Financial markets evolve. It is therefore crucial to regularly review and adjust strategy to ensure that it remains relevant and effective in the face of new market conditions.

## Contingency plan (Plan B)

Prepare a plan to deal with unforeseen scenarios. This may include technical events such as software failures or power outages, or market events such as unexpected economic announcements.

## Training and education

Make sure all team members understand the strategy, its potential risks, and what to do if problems arise. Regular training can help prevent human error.

## Conclusion

Risk management is a fundamental aspect of putting a new trading strategy into production. By adopting a methodical approach, carrying out thorough testing, and putting safeguards in place, you can minimize risk and increase the likelihood of your strategy's success in the marketplace.

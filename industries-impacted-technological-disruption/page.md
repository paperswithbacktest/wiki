# Simulate trading strategy backtest
def backtest_strategy(data, strategy):
    results = []
    for day in range(len(data)-1):
        if strategy(data.iloc[day]):
            results.append(data['close'].iloc[day+1] - data['close'].iloc[day])
    return np.sum(results)

# Example strategy based on moving average crossover
def moving_average_strategy(row):
    return row['short_ma'] > row['long_ma']

# Load data and calculate moving averages
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')
data['short_ma'] = data['close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
data['long_ma'] = data['close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Execute backtest
profit_loss = backtest_strategy(data, moving_average_strategy)
print(f"Profit/Loss from strategy: {profit_loss}")
```

## The EPAT Curriculum

The EPAT curriculum is meticulously designed to cover essential areas critical to algorithmic trading, blending theoretical foundations with practical application. It emphasizes [statistics](/wiki/bayesian-statistics), [quantitative trading](/wiki/quantitative-trading) techniques, and financial computing, all of which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the field.

A key feature of the curriculum is its focus on Python programming, a vital skill for developing and implementing trading algorithms. Participants learn to leverage Python for data manipulation, strategy development, and [backtesting](/wiki/backtesting). Additionally, the curriculum covers market microstructure, providing insights into how trading occurs in financial markets and the factors influencing market behavior.

The program also includes modules on equity and futures strategies, teaching participants how to devise effective trading strategies across different asset classes. Machine learning for trading is another critical component, where participants explore algorithms and models that can predict market movements or identify profitable trading opportunities. The following is a simple example of how a moving average crossover strategy can be implemented in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load historical price data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_prices.csv')

# Calculate moving averages
short_window = 40
long_window = 100
data['Short_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
data['Long_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

# Define trading signals
data['Signal'] = np.where(data['Short_MA'] > data['Long_MA'], 1, 0)
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Output the trading signals
print(data[['Date', 'Close', 'Short_MA', 'Long_MA', 'Signal', 'Position']])
```

Hands-on projects are integral to the EPAT curriculum, allowing participants to apply their theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. These projects help develop practical skills necessary for developing, testing, and deploying trading strategies effectively. By combining a strong theoretical background with practical experience, EPAT equips participants with the skills needed to excel in the rapidly evolving landscape of algorithmic trading.

import numpy as np

# A simple moving average crossover strategy
def backtest_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Generate signals
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Example usage
price_data = pd.DataFrame({'Close': [100, 102, 101, 105, 107, 110, 115, 112]})
signals = backtest_strategy(price_data, short_window=3, long_window=5)

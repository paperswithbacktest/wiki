```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample data: X contains predictors, y contains natural gas prices
X = np.array([[oil_price, demand, geopolitical_risk] for ...])
y = np.array([natural_gas_price for ...])

# Initialize and fit the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predicted_prices = model.predict(X_new)
```

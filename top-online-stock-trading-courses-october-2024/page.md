## What are the basic concepts of stock trading that beginners should know before enrolling in a course?

Stock trading involves buying and selling shares of companies with the goal of making a profit. When you buy a stock, you are essentially buying a small piece of that company. The price of a stock can go up or down based on many factors, like how well the company is doing, news about the company, or even general market trends. As a beginner, it's important to understand that stock prices can be unpredictable, and there's always a risk of losing money. That's why it's crucial to do your research and not invest money you can't afford to lose.

Another key concept is the difference between long-term investing and short-term trading. Long-term investing means buying stocks and holding onto them for years, hoping their value will grow over time. This approach is often less risky and can be a good way to build wealth slowly. On the other hand, short-term trading involves buying and selling stocks quickly to take advantage of short-term price movements. This can be more exciting but also more risky, as it requires a good understanding of the market and quick decision-making. Before starting, beginners should decide which approach suits their goals and risk tolerance better.

## What are fractional shares?

Fractional shares are parts of a whole stock that you can buy. Instead of buying an entire stock, you can buy a piece of it. This makes it easier for people to invest in expensive stocks without needing a lot of money. For example, if a stock costs $1,000, you could buy a fraction of it for less money, like $100 for a tenth of the stock.

Many investment apps and platforms now offer fractional shares. This is good for people who want to diversify their investments but don't have a lot of money to spend on each stock. By buying fractional shares, you can own a piece of many different companies, which can help spread out the risk in your investment portfolio.

## Why might someone want to buy fractional shares?

Someone might want to buy fractional shares because they make it easier to invest in expensive stocks. For example, if a stock costs $1,000, not everyone can afford to buy a whole share. But with fractional shares, you can buy a part of that stock for less money, like $100 for a tenth of the share. This means more people can invest in big companies that they believe in, even if they don't have a lot of money.

Another reason to buy fractional shares is to diversify your investments. When you spread your money across many different stocks, it can help lower your risk. Instead of putting all your money into one stock, you can buy small pieces of many stocks. This way, if one company does poorly, it won't hurt your whole investment as much. Fractional shares let you own a little bit of many companies, which can make your investment portfolio stronger and more balanced.

## How does Webull allow users to purchase fractional shares?

Webull lets you buy fractional shares through a feature called "dollar-based orders." This means you can choose how much money you want to spend, and Webull will buy you a piece of a stock that matches that amount. For example, if you want to spend $50 on a stock that costs $100 per share, Webull will buy you half a share. This makes it easier to invest in expensive stocks without needing a lot of money.

To use this feature, you just need to go to the stock you want to buy on the Webull app or website. Then, instead of entering the number of shares you want, you enter the amount of money you want to spend. Webull will calculate how much of the stock you can buy with that money and complete the purchase for you. This way, you can start investing in your favorite companies with whatever amount of money you have.

## What are the minimum and maximum amounts for buying fractional shares on Webull?

On Webull, the minimum amount you can spend to buy fractional shares is $5. This means you can start investing with just $5, which makes it easy for anyone to begin, even if they don't have a lot of money.

The maximum amount you can spend on a single order for fractional shares is $1,000. This limit helps keep things fair and manageable for everyone using the platform. So, whether you want to spend a little or a bit more, Webull's rules make it simple to buy the pieces of stocks you want.

## Are there any fees associated with buying fractional shares on Webull?

Webull does not charge any fees for buying or selling fractional shares. This means you can trade pieces of stocks without worrying about extra costs. It's a big plus for people who want to start investing without spending a lot of money.

However, keep in mind that while Webull itself doesn't charge fees, there might be other costs to think about. For example, if you use a payment method that has fees, like a wire transfer, you might have to pay for that. Also, if you're trading stocks that are listed on foreign exchanges, there could be currency conversion fees. So, it's good to check all the details before you start trading.

## Can you set up recurring investments in fractional shares on Webull?

Yes, you can set up recurring investments in fractional shares on Webull. This means you can tell Webull to automatically buy a certain amount of a stock every week, every two weeks, or every month. It's a great way to keep investing without having to remember to do it yourself.

To set this up, go to the stock you want to invest in on the Webull app or website. Then, choose the option to set up a recurring investment. You can pick how much money you want to spend each time and how often you want Webull to buy the stock for you. This makes it easy to keep adding to your investments regularly.

## How does the dividend distribution work for fractional shares on Webull?

When you own fractional shares on Webull, you can still get dividends. Dividends are payments that companies give to their shareholders. If a company pays a dividend, Webull will give you a part of that dividend based on how much of the stock you own. For example, if you own half a share and the company pays a $2 dividend per share, you would get $1.

The dividend payments are automatically added to your Webull account. You don't need to do anything special to get them. This makes it easy to earn a little extra money from your investments, even if you only own a piece of a stock.

## What are the tax implications of buying and selling fractional shares on Webull?

When you buy and sell fractional shares on Webull, you need to think about taxes. If you make money from selling your fractional shares for more than you paid, that's called a capital gain. You'll need to pay taxes on those gains. The tax rate depends on how long you held the shares. If you held them for less than a year, it's a short-term capital gain, and you'll pay your regular income tax rate. If you held them for more than a year, it's a long-term capital gain, and the tax rate is usually lower.

You also need to think about dividends. If you get dividends from your fractional shares, those are usually taxed too. The tax rate on dividends can be different based on whether they are qualified or non-qualified dividends. Qualified dividends are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate, which is lower, while non-qualified dividends are taxed at your regular income tax rate. It's a good idea to keep track of all your buys, sells, and dividends so you can report them correctly on your taxes.

## Can you trade fractional shares during extended hours on Webull?

Yes, you can trade fractional shares during extended hours on Webull. This means you can buy and sell pieces of stocks before the regular market opens in the morning or after it closes in the evening. It's a good option if you want to trade when you're not at work or if you think the stock price might change a lot outside of regular trading hours.

Just remember that trading during extended hours can be a bit riskier. There are usually fewer people trading, so the prices can move more quickly and be more unpredictable. But if you're okay with that, Webull makes it easy for you to trade fractional shares whenever you want.

## How does Webull handle corporate actions like stock splits or mergers for fractional shares?

When a company does a stock split or goes through a merger, Webull makes sure your fractional shares are taken care of. If there's a stock split, Webull will change the number of fractional shares you own to match the new split ratio. For example, if you have half a share and the company does a 2-for-1 split, you'll end up with a whole share. This way, your ownership stays the same, just in more pieces.

For mergers, if the company you own fractional shares in gets bought or merges with another company, Webull will handle it too. They'll give you the right amount of new shares or cash based on what you owned before. This means you don't have to worry about losing out on what you own because of the company's changes. Webull does the math and makes sure your investments are adjusted correctly.

## What are the risks associated with investing in fractional shares on Webull?

Investing in fractional shares on Webull can be a great way to start investing with less money, but it also comes with some risks. One big risk is that the stock price can go down, just like with whole shares. If you buy a piece of a stock and the price drops, you could lose money. Also, because fractional shares let you buy very small pieces of stocks, you might be tempted to buy too many different stocks. This can make your investments harder to keep track of and might spread your money too thin.

Another risk is that trading during extended hours, which Webull allows, can be more unpredictable. Fewer people are trading, so prices can change a lot more quickly. This means you could see bigger gains, but also bigger losses. It's important to think about these risks and maybe not put all your money into trading during these times. Overall, while fractional shares can help you invest in big companies with less money, it's good to be careful and understand the risks involved.

## How can advanced investors use fractional shares on Webull to diversify their portfolio?

Advanced investors can use fractional shares on Webull to diversify their portfolio by spreading their money across many different stocks. Instead of buying whole shares of just a few companies, they can buy small pieces of many companies. This way, they can invest in a wide range of industries and sectors, which helps lower the risk. If one stock or industry does poorly, it won't hurt their whole investment as much because their money is spread out.

Another way advanced investors can use fractional shares is to invest in expensive stocks that they might not be able to afford otherwise. For example, if a stock costs $1,000 per share, they can buy a piece of it for less money, like $100 for a tenth of the share. This allows them to own a part of high-value companies and still keep their portfolio diverse. By using fractional shares, advanced investors can build a more balanced and resilient investment strategy.

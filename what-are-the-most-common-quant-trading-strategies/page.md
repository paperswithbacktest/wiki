Quantitative trading strategies, or **quant strategies**, are based on mathematical and statistical models to make investment decisions. These strategies rely heavily on technology and data to predict future market movements. Here are some of the most common **quant strategies**:

- **Statistical Arbitrage (Stat Arb)**: This strategy exploits temporary price differences between closely related assets. For example, if two stocks have historically moved together and one temporarily deviates from this relationship, the trader may take a long position on the undervalued stock and a short position on the overvalued stock, expecting them to converge again.
- **Pair Trading**: A sub-category of Statistical Arbitrage. It involves taking opposite positions on two stocks whose price movements are historically correlated.
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: As its name suggests, **HFT** involves executing a large number of orders in a very short time, often in milliseconds or microseconds. These strategies exploit tiny price differentials and are highly sensitive to execution speed.
- **Trend Following**: This strategy follows market trends, taking long positions in bull markets and short positions in bear markets. It can use indicators such as moving averages.
- **Market Making**: Traders using this strategy simultaneously offer to buy and sell a financial instrument with the aim of profiting from the spread between the buying and selling price.
- **Factor Investing**: This approach is based on identifying factors (such as value, size, momentum) that are thought to be associated with superior returns.
- **Machine Learning and AI Trading**: With advances in artificial intelligence, more and more strategies are based on machine learning algorithms that train on historical data to predict future price movements.
- **Risk Parity**: This strategy aims to allocate capital in such a way as to balance the contribution of each asset to the portfolio's total risk.
- **Global Macro Quant**: These strategies rely on quantitative models to predict global macroeconomic movements and profit from them through various financial instruments.

In conclusion, **quantitative trading strategies** offer a multitude of approaches for navigating the financial markets. The effectiveness of these strategies often depends on the quality of the models, data, and technology used, as well as the ability to manage the associated risks.

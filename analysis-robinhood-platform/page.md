```python
import pandas as pd

def moving_average_strategy(data, short_window=40, long_window=100):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Calculate short and long moving averages
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals
```

In recent years, algorithmic trading has grown significantly in popularity, with advancements in technology and the availability of big data fueling its evolution. Notably, [machine learning](/wiki/machine-learning) and [artificial intelligence](/wiki/ai-artificial-intelligence) have introduced sophisticated models that enhance prediction accuracy and adaptability to market changes.

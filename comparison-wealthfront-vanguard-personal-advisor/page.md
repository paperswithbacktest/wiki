## What are Wealthfront and Vanguard Personal Advisor?

Wealthfront is an automated investment service, also known as a robo-advisor. It helps people invest their money by creating a personalized investment plan based on their goals and how much risk they're willing to take. Wealthfront uses computer algorithms to manage your investments, which means it's less expensive than hiring a human financial advisor. It's a good choice for people who want to invest but don't want to spend a lot of time or money managing their investments.

Vanguard Personal Advisor is another robo-advisor that offers automated investment management. Like Wealthfront, it creates a customized investment plan for you based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Vanguard Personal Advisor also provides access to human financial advisors if you need help or have questions. This service is a bit more expensive than Wealthfront, but it might be worth it if you want the option to talk to a real person about your investments.

## How do Wealthfront and Vanguard Personal Advisor differ in terms of fees?

Wealthfront charges a management fee of 0.25% per year on the assets they manage for you. This means if you have $10,000 invested with Wealthfront, you'll pay $25 a year for their service. Wealthfront doesn't charge any additional fees for trading or account management, which makes it a straightforward and affordable option for people looking to invest without spending a lot on fees.

Vanguard Personal Advisor, on the other hand, charges a slightly higher management fee of 0.30% per year. So, if you have $10,000 invested with Vanguard, you'll pay $30 a year. While this fee is a bit higher than Wealthfront's, Vanguard includes access to human financial advisors as part of their service, which might be valuable if you want personalized advice and support. Both services offer low-cost investment options, but the choice between them might depend on whether you prefer the lower fee or the added benefit of human advisor access.

Wealthfront has a very low minimum investment requirement. You can start investing with them for just $500. This makes it easy for people who don't have a lot of money to start investing and grow their savings over time.

Vanguard Personal Advisor requires a higher minimum investment. You need at least $50,000 to open an account with them. This might be good for people who already have a good amount of money saved and want to invest it with the help of both automated tools and human advisors.

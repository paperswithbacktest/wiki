Lambda functions facilitate this process through their event-driven nature. When market conditions match specific criteria, pre-defined Lambda functions trigger the instantaneous execution of trading strategies, enhancing decision speed and reducing latency. For example:

```python
def trading_decision(event, context):
    # Process incoming market data
    if event['price'] < predefined_threshold:
        execute_buy_order(event['asset'])
    elif event['price'] > another_threshold:
        execute_sell_order(event['asset'])

    return "Order executed based on strategy"
```

This function processes real-time market data and executes transactions based on predetermined conditions, exemplifying the agile capabilities Lambda technology introduces to trading.

In summary, the flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of Lambda functions make them a valuable asset in modern algorithmic trading, enabling traders to efficiently manage computations and automate critical processes.

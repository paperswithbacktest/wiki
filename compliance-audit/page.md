```python
# Example: Simplified Algorithmic Trading Strategy in Python

import pandas as pd

# Assume 'data' is a DataFrame with historical stock prices
# Here is a simplistic moving average crossover strategy

# Calculate short and long moving averages
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Generate Buy and Sell signals
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA_50'][50:] > data['SMA_200'][50:], 1, 0)

# Determine trading positions
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Display signals
print(data[['Close', 'SMA_50', 'SMA_200', 'Position']].dropna())
```

The above code snippet illustrates a basic moving average crossover strategy, where the system generates buy signals when a short-term moving average surpasses a long-term moving average, indicating a potential upward trend in price.

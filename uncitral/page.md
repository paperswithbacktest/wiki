The process for developing texts at UNCITRAL starts with identifying a problem in international trade that needs a solution. UNCITRAL's member states, which are chosen by the United Nations General Assembly, work together to figure out what the problem is and how to fix it. They might talk to businesses, lawyers, and other experts to get ideas. Once they have a good understanding of the problem, they start writing a draft of the text. This draft is like a first version of the rules they want to create.

After the draft is written, UNCITRAL shares it with countries and other groups to get their feedback. They might hold meetings where people can talk about the draft and suggest changes. UNCITRAL listens to all the feedback and makes changes to the draft to make it better. This can take a long time because they want to make sure the rules are fair and will work well for everyone. Once everyone agrees on the final version, the text is finished and ready for countries to use.

## How does UNCITRAL ensure the implementation of its texts?

Each working group focuses on a specific problem in international trade, like buying and selling goods across borders or solving disagreements without going to court. They talk to experts and businesses to understand the problem better and then write a draft of the rules. This draft is shared with countries and other groups to get feedback and make it better.

Once the working group has a good draft, they keep working on it until everyone agrees on the final version. This can take a long time because they want to make sure the rules are fair and will work well for everyone. The working groups help UNCITRAL by doing the detailed work of writing and improving the rules. They make sure that the texts are ready for countries to use and help solve real problems in international trade.

## How can countries that are not members of UNCITRAL participate in its work?

Countries that are not members of UNCITRAL can still take part in its work. They can join meetings and give their ideas about the rules UNCITRAL is making. This helps make sure that the rules are fair and work well for everyone, not just the member countries. Non-member countries can also use the rules that UNCITRAL creates, even if they did not help make them. This means they can make the rules part of their own laws and use them when they trade with other countries.

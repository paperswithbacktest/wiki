## What is an 'Ankle Biter'?

In financial jargon, an 'ankle biter' refers to a stock with a low market capitalization, typically under $500 million. This term draws a metaphorical parallel to small, aggressive animals known for their tendency to nip at ankles, symbolizing how smaller companies often challenge more established, larger entities in the market. Ankle biters are synonymous with micro-cap or small-cap stocks, which are characterized by their high volatility and generally low trading volumes.

Micro-cap stocks, as the name suggests, have a considerably smaller market capitalization compared to larger-cap stocks. The market capitalization of a company is calculated as:

$$
\text{Market Capitalization} = \text{Share Price} \times \text{Number of Outstanding Shares}
$$

This metric provides an estimate of the company's total equity value. Companies that are labeled as ankle biters usually fall well below the $500 million mark in this calculation.

The high [volatility](/wiki/volatility-trading-strategies) of ankle biters can be attributed to several factors, including their often limited access to capital, less predictable earnings, and susceptibility to market or sector-specific fluctuations. These stocks tend to have thin trading volumes, meaning they are less frequently traded compared to larger stocks, which can lead to larger price swings and greater price impact from trades.

Despite their risks, ankle biter stocks offer investors potential for significant growth. These companies are often part of emerging industries or innovative sectors where the potential for rapid expansion and market disruption is substantial. Investors attracted to ankle biters are typically looking for companies with the potential to grow significantly, perhaps transitioning from being a minor player to becoming a major industry contender. Thus, while they present a higher risk, the rewards can be substantial if an investment in an ankle biter pays off over time.

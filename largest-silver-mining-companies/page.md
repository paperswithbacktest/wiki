## What is silver mining?

Silver mining is the process of extracting silver from the earth. People dig into the ground to find rocks that have silver in them. They use big machines and tools to break the rocks and get the silver out. This has been done for a very long time because silver is valuable and used in many things like jewelry, coins, and electronics.

There are different ways to mine silver. One way is underground mining, where miners go deep into the earth to find silver.

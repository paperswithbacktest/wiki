# Sample data generation
weather_data = np.random.random((1000, 10))  # 1000 samples, 10 features
market_performance = np.random.random((1000, 1))  # 1000 samples

# LSTM Model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, input_shape=(weather_data.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(Dense(1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
model.fit(weather_data, market_performance, epochs=100, batch_size=32)

# Predict using new weather data
new_weather_data = np.random.random((1, 10))
predicted_performance = model.predict(new_weather_data)
```

Continuous testing and optimization are crucial to refine these models and enhance predictive accuracy.

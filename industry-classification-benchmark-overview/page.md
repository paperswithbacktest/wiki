Here's a simple Python example using pandas for data structuring:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data setup
data = {'Company': ['A', 'B', 'C'],
        'Sector': ['Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Finance'],
        'Revenue': [100, 200, 150]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group data by sector
grouped = df.groupby('Sector').sum()

# Analyze sector performance
print(grouped)
```

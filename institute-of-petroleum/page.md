## What is the Institute of Petroleum?

The Institute of Petroleum, often called the IP, was a professional organization in the United Kingdom. It was focused on the oil and gas industry. The IP worked to improve standards, education, and research in the petroleum field. It was started in 1913 and helped many people in the industry learn and grow.

In 2003, the Institute of Petroleum joined with two other groups to form a new organization called the Energy Institute. This new group continued the work of the IP but included a broader focus on all types of energy. The Energy Institute still helps professionals in the energy sector today, keeping the spirit of the IP alive.

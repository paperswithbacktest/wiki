## What are M1 Finance and E*TRADE Core Portfolios?

M1 Finance is an investment platform that lets you create and manage your own investment portfolios. You can pick from pre-made portfolios or build your own by choosing stocks and ETFs. M1 Finance uses a system called "pies" to help you organize your investments. It's easy to use and doesn't charge you for trading. They also offer features like automatic investing and borrowing against your portfolio.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios is a robo-advisor service provided by E*TRADE. It automatically manages your investments based on your goals and risk tolerance. You fill out a questionnaire, and E*TRADE builds a diversified portfolio for you using ETFs. They handle the rebalancing and reinvesting of dividends. There's a small fee for using this service, but it's a good option if you want a hands-off approach to investing.

## How do the fee structures of M1 Finance and E*TRADE Core Portfolios compare?

M1 Finance has a simple fee structure. They don't charge you for trading or to use their basic services. But, if you want to use M1 Plus, which gives you extra features like borrowing against your portfolio, it costs $10 a month or $95 a year. M1 Finance also charges a small fee if you want to take money out of your account quickly.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios charges a fee based on how much money you have invested. If you have less than $500,000, you pay 0.30% of your account's value each year. If you have more than $500,000, the fee goes down to 0.25%. There are no extra fees for trading or managing your account. This fee structure makes E*TRADE Core Portfolios a bit more expensive than M1 Finance for smaller accounts, but it might be cheaper for bigger ones.

## What types of investment options are available on M1 Finance and E*TRADE Core Portfolios?

M1 Finance lets you invest in a lot of different things. You can choose from stocks and ETFs to build your own portfolio. They call these portfolios "pies," and you can make your own or pick from ones they already made. The pre-made pies cover different goals like saving for retirement or making money from dividends. M1 Finance also lets you invest in things like real estate and cryptocurrencies through special pies.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios is simpler. It uses ETFs to build your investment portfolio. You answer some questions about what you want to achieve and how much risk you're okay with, and then E*TRADE picks the right ETFs for you. They take care of everything, like making sure your investments stay balanced and putting dividend money back into your portfolio. So, if you want something easy and don't want to pick your own investments, E*TRADE Core Portfolios is good for that.

## How do the account minimums differ between M1 Finance and E*TRADE Core Portfolios?

M1 Finance does not have any account minimums. This means you can start investing with any amount of money you have. Whether you want to put in $10 or $10,000, M1 Finance lets you begin right away without needing a certain amount to open an account.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios, on the other hand, has a minimum account requirement. You need at least $500 to start investing with them. This means you have to save up that amount before you can begin using their robo-advisor service to manage your investments.

## Can you explain the tax strategies offered by M1 Finance and E*TRADE Core Portfolios?

M1 Finance helps you with taxes by letting you use something called tax-loss harvesting.

They do this automatically if you have an M1 Plus account. M1 Finance also lets you invest in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs, which can help you save on taxes over time. These accounts have special rules that can make your investments grow without being taxed right away.

They keep an eye on your investments and will sell ones that have lost value to help reduce your taxes. E*TRADE also lets you open tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs.

Then, E*TRADE builds a portfolio for you and manages it automatically. The interface shows you how your investments are doing and lets you make changes if you need to.

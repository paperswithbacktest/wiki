## What is common stock?

Common stock is a type of security that represents ownership in a company. When you buy common stock, you become a shareholder, which means you own a small part of the company. This gives you the right to vote on certain company decisions, like who should be on the board of directors. Common stock is different from other types of stock, like preferred stock, because it usually comes with voting rights.

One of the main benefits of owning common stock is the potential to earn money. Shareholders can make money in two ways: through dividends and capital gains. Dividends are payments that companies sometimes give to their shareholders out of their profits. Capital gains happen when the price of the stock goes up and you sell it for more than you paid. However, common stock can also be risky because the value of the stock can go down, and you might lose money.

## What is preferred stock?

Preferred stock is another type of stock that companies can issue. It's different from common stock because it usually doesn't give you voting rights. This means you can't vote on things like who should be on the company's board of directors. But, preferred stock has some advantages. One big advantage is that it often pays a fixed dividend. This means you get a regular payment, kind of like interest from a savings account, but it comes from the company's profits.

Another important thing about preferred stock is that it gets paid before common stock if the company goes bankrupt. This makes it a bit safer than common stock because you're more likely to get some money back if the company fails. But, preferred stock can also have some downsides. For example, the dividends might not grow over time like they can with common stock, and if the company does really well, you might not get as much benefit as common stockholders.

## How does voting rights differ between common and preferred stock?

Voting rights are a big difference between common and preferred stock. If you own common stock, you usually get to vote on important company decisions. This includes things like who should be on the board of directors. Each share of common stock typically gives you one vote, so the more shares you own, the more say you have in the company.

On the other hand, if you own preferred stock, you usually don't get any voting rights. This means you can't vote on who should be on the board or other big decisions. Preferred stockholders give up this right in exchange for other benefits, like getting paid dividends before common stockholders and having a higher claim on assets if the company goes bankrupt.

## What are the dividend payment differences between common and preferred stock?

When it comes to dividends, common stock and preferred stock work differently. Common stock dividends are not fixed. This means the company can decide whether to pay them or not, and how much to pay. If the company does well, it might pay bigger dividends. But if it doesn't do well, it might pay smaller dividends or none at all. Common stockholders are last in line to get dividends, after preferred stockholders and other creditors.

Preferred stock dividends are usually fixed. This means you know how much you'll get, and it's the same amount each time. Preferred stockholders get paid their dividends before common stockholders. If the company can't pay all its dividends, preferred stockholders get paid first. But, if the company does really well, preferred stockholders won't get any extra money, unlike common stockholders who might get bigger dividends.

## In what ways does the priority in asset distribution upon liquidation vary between common and preferred stock?

When a company goes bankrupt and has to liquidate its assets, the order in which shareholders get paid matters a lot. Preferred stockholders have a higher priority than common stockholders. This means that if there's any money left after the company pays off all its debts and other obligations, preferred stockholders get their share first. They might even get back the money they originally paid for their shares, depending on the terms of the stock.

Common stockholders, on the other hand, are at the very end of the line. They only get paid if there's any money left after everyone else, including preferred stockholders, has been paid. This makes common stock riskier because there's a good chance there won't be anything left for them. But if the company does have money left over, common stockholders can share in it, which might be more than what preferred stockholders get.

## How does the risk level associated with common stock compare to preferred stock?

Common stock is generally riskier than preferred stock. If you own common stock, you're at the back of the line when it comes to getting paid dividends or getting money back if the company goes bankrupt. This means you could lose all your money if the company does really badly. But, common stock also has the potential for bigger rewards. If the company does well, the value of your stock can go up a lot, and you might get bigger dividends.

Preferred stock is usually safer because it comes with a fixed dividend and a higher claim on the company's assets if it goes bankrupt. This means you're more likely to get some of your money back, and you know how much you'll get in dividends. But, preferred stock also has less potential for big gains. If the company does really well, you won't get any extra money beyond your fixed dividend, and the value of your stock might not go up as much as common stock.

## What are the conversion rights, if any, for preferred stock into common stock?

Some preferred stocks come with the option to convert them into common stocks. This is called a conversion right. If you have this right, you can choose to trade your preferred shares for a certain number of common shares. The number of common shares you get depends on the conversion ratio set by the company. This can be useful if you think the company will do really well and you want to benefit from the potential growth in the value of common stock.

Not all preferred stocks have conversion rights, though. When a company issues preferred stock, it will say in the stock's terms whether you can convert it or not. If your preferred stock does have this right, it gives you more flexibility. You can keep getting the fixed dividends if you want, or you can switch to common stock if you think it will be more profitable. But, you need to think carefully about when to convert because once you do, you can't change your mind and go back to preferred stock.

## How do the potential returns differ between investing in common versus preferred stock?

When you invest in common stock, you have the chance to make a lot of money if the company does well. The price of common stock can go up a lot, and if you sell it when it's high, you can make a big profit. Also, if the company makes a lot of money, it might give you bigger dividends. But, common stock is riskier. If the company does badly, the price of the stock can go down a lot, and you might lose money. Plus, you only get dividends if the company decides to pay them, and you're last in line to get any money if the company goes bankrupt.

Investing in preferred stock is usually safer but with less chance for big gains. Preferred stock often pays a fixed dividend, so you know exactly how much you'll get. This can be good if you want a steady income. Also, if the company goes bankrupt, preferred stockholders get paid before common stockholders, so you're more likely to get some of your money back. But, the price of preferred stock doesn't usually go up as much as common stock, even if the company does really well. And, you won't get any extra money from bigger dividends if the company makes a lot of profit.

## What are the tax implications for investors holding common versus preferred stock?

When you hold common stock, the tax implications can be different depending on what you do with the stock. If you get dividends from common stock, those dividends are usually taxed as ordinary income. This means they're taxed at your regular income tax rate, which can be pretty high. If you sell your common stock for more than you paid for it, you'll have a capital gain. If you held the stock for more than a year, you'll pay a lower long-term capital gains tax rate, which is usually less than your regular income tax rate. But if you sold it within a year, you'll pay the higher short-term capital gains tax rate, which is the same as your regular income tax rate.

For preferred stock, the tax treatment can be a bit different, especially when it comes to dividends. Preferred stock dividends are often qualified dividends, which means they're taxed at the lower long-term capital gains tax rate, not your regular income tax rate. This can save you money on taxes. Just like with common stock, if you sell your preferred stock for a profit, you'll have a capital gain. The tax rate on that gain depends on how long you held the stock. If you held it for more than a year, you'll pay the long-term capital gains tax rate. If you held it for a year or less, you'll pay the short-term capital gains tax rate, which is the same as your regular income tax rate.

## How do market conditions affect the valuation of common and preferred stock differently?

Market conditions can have a big impact on the value of both common and preferred stock, but they affect them in different ways. Common stock is more sensitive to market changes because its value can go up and down a lot based on how well the company is doing and what investors think about the future. If people think the company will do well, the price of common stock can go up a lot. But if there's bad news or the market is doing badly, the price can drop quickly. This makes common stock riskier but also gives it the potential for big gains.

Preferred stock, on the other hand, is usually less affected by market ups and downs. This is because preferred stock often has a fixed dividend, so its value doesn't change as much. Investors see preferred stock as safer because they know how much they'll get in dividends, no matter what the market is doing. But, this also means that preferred stock doesn't usually go up in value as much as common stock when the market is doing well. So, while preferred stock can be a good choice if you want something more stable, it might not give you the big gains that common stock can offer.

## What are the typical uses of preferred stock by corporations, and how do these differ from the uses of common stock?

Companies use preferred stock for different reasons than common stock. Preferred stock is often used to raise money without giving up control of the company. Since preferred stock usually doesn't come with voting rights, the people who own it can't vote on who runs the company. This can be good for the company because it can get money from investors without letting them have a say in how the business is run. Also, preferred stock can be attractive to investors who want a steady income because it usually pays a fixed dividend. Companies might also use preferred stock to attract investors who want a safer investment, since preferred stockholders get paid before common stockholders if the company has money problems.

Common stock, on the other hand, is used to raise money and share ownership with investors. When a company sells common stock, it's giving investors a piece of the company and the right to vote on important decisions, like who should be on the board of directors. This can be good for the company because it can bring in money and also get more people interested in the company's success. Common stock is also used to reward employees through stock options, which can help motivate them to work hard and help the company grow. But, it's riskier for the company because common stockholders can influence how the company is run, and they're last in line to get paid if the company runs into trouble.

## How do the features of callable preferred stock influence investor decisions compared to non-callable common stock?

Callable preferred stock gives the company the right to buy back the stock from investors at a set price after a certain date. This can affect investor decisions because it adds a layer of risk. If the company decides to call the stock, investors might have to give up their shares and lose the chance to keep [earning](/wiki/earning-announcement) the fixed dividends. This can make callable preferred stock less appealing to some investors who want a steady income without the worry of the company taking back their investment. On the other hand, if interest rates drop, the company might call the stock to issue new preferred stock at a lower dividend rate, which can be good for the company but not as good for the investor.

Non-callable common stock, on the other hand, doesn't have this risk. Once you buy non-callable common stock, the company can't force you to sell it back. This can make it more attractive to investors who want to hold onto their shares for a long time and benefit from potential growth in the company's value. Common stock also gives you voting rights, which can be important if you want to have a say in how the company is run. However, common stock is riskier because it's last in line to get paid if the company runs into trouble, and its value can go up and down a lot based on market conditions.

Backtesting is crucial; it involves testing a strategy on historical data to assess its viability in actual trading scenarios. Understanding basic concepts such as rolling averages or using the Sharpe ratio to measure risk-adjusted returns is common practice.

Python code for backtesting a simple moving average strategy might look like this:

```python
# Calculate the short and long-term moving averages
data['SMA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Identify when to buy and sell
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA50'][50:] > data['SMA200'][50:], 1, 0)
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Visualize the results
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price')
plt.plot(data['SMA50'], label='50-Day SMA')
plt.plot(data['SMA200'], label='200-Day SMA')
plt.plot(data[data['Position'] == 1].index, data['SMA50'][data['Position'] == 1], '^', label='Buy Signal', markersize=12, color='g')
plt.plot(data[data['Position'] == -1].index, data['SMA50'][data['Position'] == -1], 'v', label='Sell Signal', markersize=12, color='r')
plt.title('Trading Strategy Backtesting')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

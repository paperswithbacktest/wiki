The company became very popular because of its funny commercials featuring a sock puppet dog. People remembered the ads, and the company grew quickly.

However, Pets.com had big problems. It was spending too much money on advertising and not making enough money from selling pet supplies. The company tried to fix this by changing how it worked, but it was too late. In 2000, just two years after it started, Pets.com had to close down. It is remembered as a famous example of the risks of starting a business during the dot-com boom.

Greg McLemore worked with other people to make Pets.com happen. One important person was Julie Wainwright, who helped lead the company.

Pets.com spent a lot on ads to get more customers, but they were not making enough money from selling pet supplies.

When the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, it meant that people stopped investing in internet companies so much. Many businesses that were not making money had to close down. Pets.com was one of them.

The failure of Pets.com also made investors more cautious. Before Pets.com collapsed, many people were excited about internet businesses and were willing to invest a lot of money in them. After Pets.com failed, investors started to look more closely at whether a business could actually make money. This change helped to create a more stable e-commerce industry, where companies had to show they could be successful in the long run.

## What lessons can be learned from the collapse of Pets.com?

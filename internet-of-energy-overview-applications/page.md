To illustrate the impact of smart grids operationally, consider this simplified Python function that represents the load forecasting based on IoT sensor data:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def forecast_energy_demand(sensor_data):
    # Assume sensor_data is a 2D numpy array where rows represent different sensors
    # and columns represent time-series data points (e.g., hourly data).

    time_steps = sensor_data.shape[1]
    energy_demand = []

    # Use a linear regression model for simplicity
    model = LinearRegression()

    # Train the model with historical sensor data
    X = np.arange(time_steps).reshape(-1, 1)  # Time steps as features
    y = sensor_data.mean(axis=0)  # Average demand per time step as target

    model.fit(X, y)

    # Forecast the next time step demand
    next_step = np.array([[time_steps]])
    forecasted_demand = model.predict(next_step)

    return forecasted_demand[0]

# Example usage:
sensor_data_example = np.random.rand(10, 24)  # Example with 10 sensors collecting 24 hours of data
predicted_demand = forecast_energy_demand(sensor_data_example)
print(f"Predicted energy demand for the next time step: {predicted_demand}")
```

This code provides a simplistic approach to predict future energy demand by using averages from IoT sensors, demonstrating how leveraging IoT data can optimize energy utilization in smart grids. As technology advances, the role of smart grids within the IoE will continue to grow, playing an essential role in the sustainable integration of renewable energy sources and the enhancement of grid resilience.

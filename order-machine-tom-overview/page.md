## What is The Order Machine (TOM)?

The Order Machine (TOM) is a system used by the United States Postal Service (USPS) to sort and process mail and packages. It helps postal workers handle a large amount of mail quickly and efficiently. TOM uses special machines and computers to read addresses and sort items into the right bins or containers. This makes sure that letters and packages get to where they need to go faster.

TOM is important because it helps the USPS manage the huge volume of mail that people send every day. Without TOM, it would take a lot longer to sort and deliver mail. The system also helps reduce errors, so fewer items get lost or sent to the wrong place. By using TOM, the USPS can keep up with the demands of delivering mail across the country.

## Who developed The Order Machine (TOM)?

The Order Machine (TOM) was developed by the United States Postal Service (USPS) with help from different technology companies. The USPS worked with these companies to create machines and computer systems that could read addresses and sort mail quickly. They wanted to make sure that TOM could handle a lot of mail every day without making mistakes.

Over time, the USPS kept improving TOM to make it even better. They added new technology and updated the software to keep up with more mail and new types of packages.

Another important security feature of TOM is that it can tell if someone tries to do something they shouldn't.

This means that even if a business has unique needs, TOM can be adjusted to make sure their mail gets sorted and delivered the way they want it to. By letting businesses customize it, TOM helps them work better and keep their customers happy.

## What are the advanced analytics and reporting capabilities of TOM?

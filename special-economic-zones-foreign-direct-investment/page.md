## Understanding Special Economic Zones (SEZs)

Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are designated areas within a country that possess distinct economic regulations compared to the rest of the nation. These zones are created to promote economic activity by offering benefits such as tax incentives, reduced import/export duties, and relaxed regulatory requirements. SEZs aim to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), boost industrial growth, enhance employment opportunities, and increase export volumes.

SEZs play a critical role in global trade and investment by providing an attractive environment for businesses to establish operations. Their strategic setup allows countries to foster an economic enclave that is more conducive to commercial activities than other parts of the country. SEZs contribute to the diversification of the host country's economy by attracting various industries, thereby fostering economic resilience and stability.

There are several types of SEZs, each tailored to specific economic objectives:

1. **Free-Trade Zones (FTZs):** FTZs are areas typically located near ports of entry where goods may be imported, stored, and exported with fewer customs regulations and duties. The primary purpose of FTZs is to encourage international trade by reducing logistical and cost barriers.

2. **Export Processing Zones (EPZs):** EPZs focus on manufacturing goods primarily for export purposes. They offer incentives such as tax exemptions on exports and duty-free imports of raw materials and intermediate goods. The aim is to enhance a country's export capabilities and integrate it into the global supply chain.

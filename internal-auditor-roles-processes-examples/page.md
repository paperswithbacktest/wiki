# Sample structure of a trading algorithm in Python
class TradingAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self, data_feed):
        self.data_feed = data_feed  # Input data

    def decide(self):
        # Decision-making logic based on data inputs
        if self.data_feed.current_price > self.data_feed.moving_average():
            return "BUY"
        elif self.data_feed.current_price < self.data_feed.moving_average():
            return "SELL"
        else:
            return "HOLD"

# Example usage
data_feed = DataFeed(current_price=105, moving_average=100)  # Mock data feed
algorithm = TradingAlgorithm(data_feed)
trade_action = algorithm.decide()
```

A crucial component of the audit process is validating the back-testing and real-time monitoring systems utilized by the trading algorithms.

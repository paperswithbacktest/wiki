## What are fractional shares?

Fractional shares are parts of a whole stock that you can buy. Instead of buying a whole stock, which can be expensive, you can buy a smaller piece of it. This means you can invest in big companies even if you don't have a lot of money. For example, if a stock costs $1000 and you only have $100, you can still buy 1/10th of that stock.

Fractional shares are helpful for people who want to diversify their investments. Diversifying means spreading your money across different investments to reduce risk. With fractional shares, you can own parts of many different companies, even if each company's stock is pricey. This way, you can build a varied investment portfolio without needing a lot of money upfront.

## Why would someone want to purchase fractional shares?

Someone might want to buy fractional shares because they make it easier to invest in expensive stocks. If a stock costs a lot of money, like $1,000, not everyone can afford to buy a whole share. But with fractional shares, you can buy just a part of that stock, like $100 worth. This means you can still own a piece of big companies without needing a lot of money all at once.

Another reason to buy fractional shares is to help spread out your investments. When you invest, it's smart to put your money into different things to lower your risk. Fractional shares let you buy small pieces of many different stocks, even if each one is pricey. This way, you can build a varied investment portfolio without needing a big chunk of money to start.

## How does Fidelity Investments allow you to buy fractional shares?

Fidelity Investments lets you buy fractional shares through their platform called Fidelity's Stock Slices. With Stock Slices, you can buy pieces of stocks from popular companies. You don't need a lot of money to start; you can buy as little as $1 worth of a stock. This makes it easy for anyone to invest in big companies without having to buy a whole share.

To get started, you just need to open an account with Fidelity and find the Stock Slices section. Once you're there, you can choose which companies you want to invest in and decide how much money you want to spend. Fidelity will then buy the fractional shares for you. It's a simple way to own part of a company and build your investment portfolio, even if you're just starting out with a small amount of money.

## What are the minimum investment amounts for fractional shares at Fidelity?

At Fidelity, you can start investing in fractional shares with as little as $1. This means you don't need a lot of money to buy a piece of a big company. If you want to invest in a stock that costs a lot, like $1,000 per share, you can still get started by buying just $1 worth of it.

This low minimum investment amount makes it easy for anyone to begin building an investment portfolio. Whether you're saving up or just starting to invest, you can use Fidelity's Stock Slices to buy fractional shares in many different companies. This way, you can spread your money across various investments without needing a big sum of money upfront.

## Can you set up automatic investments in fractional shares through Fidelity?

Yes, you can set up automatic investments in fractional shares through Fidelity. This means you can tell Fidelity to take a certain amount of money from your account regularly, like every month, and use it to buy more fractional shares. It's a good way to keep growing your investments without having to remember to do it yourself each time.

Setting up automatic investments is easy. You just need to go into your Fidelity account, find the option for automatic investments, and choose how much money you want to invest and how often. Once you set it up, Fidelity will do the rest, buying the fractional shares for you on the schedule you picked. This way, you can slowly build your investment portfolio over time, even if you start with small amounts.

## What types of stocks or funds can you buy as fractional shares at Fidelity?

At Fidelity, you can buy fractional shares of many different types of stocks. This includes stocks from big companies like Apple, Amazon, and Google. You can also buy shares in smaller companies if you want. The great thing is, you can pick from a wide range of industries, so you can find stocks that match what you're interested in or what you believe will do well in the future.

Besides individual stocks, Fidelity also lets you buy fractional shares of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs are like baskets of stocks that you can buy all at once. They can focus on things like technology, healthcare, or even the whole stock market. This means you can easily diversify your investments by buying small pieces of these ETFs, even if you don't have a lot of money to start with.

## Are there any fees associated with buying fractional shares at Fidelity?

At Fidelity, you don't have to pay any extra fees just for buying fractional shares. This means you can buy small pieces of stocks without worrying about added costs. It's great because it makes investing easier and cheaper, especially if you're just starting out or don't have a lot of money to invest.

However, remember that other fees might still apply. For example, if you use a Fidelity account that charges a yearly fee, you'll still have to pay that. Also, if you're buying and selling stocks a lot, you might have to pay trading fees or other charges that come with those actions. So, it's good to check all the details of your account to understand any other costs you might have.

## How do dividends work with fractional shares at Fidelity?

When you own fractional shares at Fidelity, you can still earn dividends just like if you owned whole shares. Dividends are payments that companies sometimes give to their shareholders. If a company decides to pay a dividend, Fidelity will calculate how much you should get based on the part of the stock you own. For example, if you own 1/10th of a share and the company pays a $1 dividend per share, you would get $0.10.

Fidelity will either add these dividend payments to your account as cash, or you can choose to have them automatically reinvested to buy more fractional shares. This way, your investment can grow over time without you having to do anything extra. It's a nice way to keep building your portfolio, even with small amounts of money.

## Can you sell fractional shares at any time through Fidelity?

Yes, you can sell your fractional shares at Fidelity whenever you want. If you decide you want to sell a part of your stock, you can do it easily through their website or app. You don't have to wait for a special time or meet any special rules. Just go to your account, pick the fractional share you want to sell, and tell Fidelity how much of it you want to get rid of.

When you sell, Fidelity will give you the money from the sale right away. The amount you get will depend on the current price of the stock. If you're selling a small piece of a big stock, you'll get a smaller amount of money, but it's still easy and quick to do. This way, you can change your investments whenever you feel like it, without any hassle.

## How does voting work with fractional shares at Fidelity?

When you own fractional shares at Fidelity, you can still vote in company meetings. But, your voting power depends on how much of the stock you own. If you own a small piece of a stock, you get a smaller say in the voting. For example, if you own 1/10th of a share, you might get 1/10th of a vote.

Fidelity makes it easy for you to vote. They'll let you know when there's a vote coming up and you can tell them how you want to vote through their website or app. Even if you only own a small part of a stock, your voice still matters, and Fidelity helps you use it.

## What are the tax implications of buying and selling fractional shares at Fidelity?

When you buy and sell fractional shares at Fidelity, you need to think about taxes. If you make money from selling your fractional shares for more than you paid for them, that's called a capital gain. You'll have to pay taxes on those gains. The tax rate depends on how long you held the shares. If you held them for less than a year, it's a short-term capital gain, and you'll pay your regular income tax rate. If you held them for more than a year, it's a long-term capital gain, and the tax rate is usually lower.

Also, if the companies you own fractional shares in pay dividends, those dividends are usually taxable too. The tax rate on dividends can be different based on whether they are qualified or non-qualified dividends. Qualified dividends are taxed at the same rate as long-term capital gains, which is usually lower than your regular income tax rate. Non-qualified dividends are taxed at your regular income tax rate. It's a good idea to keep track of your buys and sells and talk to a tax professional to make sure you understand all the tax rules that apply to your investments.

## How does Fidelity handle the tracking and reporting of fractional share transactions?

Fidelity makes it easy to keep track of your fractional share transactions. When you buy or sell fractional shares, Fidelity records all these actions in your account. You can see all your buys and sells on their website or app. They show you how much you paid for each piece of a stock and how much you got when you sold it. This way, you can always know exactly what's happening with your investments.

Fidelity also helps you with tax reporting. At the end of the year, they send you a form called a 1099-B. This form lists all your transactions, including the ones with fractional shares. It shows how much money you made or lost from selling your shares. This makes it easier for you to report your taxes correctly. If you have any questions, Fidelity's customer service can help you understand everything.

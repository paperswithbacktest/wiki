signals = pd.DataFrame(index=prices.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0

signals['short_mavg'] = prices.rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
signals['long_mavg'] = prices.rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Generate signals
signals['signal'][short_window:] = \
    np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
```

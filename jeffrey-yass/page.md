## What is your trading philosophy?

Jeffrey Yass's trading philosophy centers on a strategic approach borrowed from his experience in poker: betting against less informed adversaries. This principle has been instrumental in allowing Susquehanna International Group (SIG) to sustain its competitive advantage in the financial markets. The concept parallels the idea of identifying opportunities where market participants lack critical information, akin to bluffing in poker where a player reads the opponents to understand when to make strategic bets.

Yass's philosophy is deeply rooted in probabilistic thinking and rigorous risk management. He perceives the market as a collection of uncertain events, where the goal is to assess the probabilities accurately and make decisions that offer positive expected value. This is mathematically represented as:

$$
\text{Expected Value} (EV) = \sum (p_i \times v_i)
$$

where $p_i$ is the probability of a certain outcome and $v_i$ is the value of that outcome. Successful trading, in Yass's view, hinges on executing trades with a positive EV, much like making bets in poker that have a high likelihood of returning a profit.

Risk management is another cornerstone of Yass's trading philosophy. He emphasizes the importance of controlling exposure to losses while maximizing potential gains. This involves employing strategies such as diversification and hedging to mitigate risk. Moreover, maintaining discipline in trading decisions is crucial. Yass advocates for sticking to a predefined strategy and avoiding emotional reactions to market fluctuations, akin to maintaining a poker face in dealing with unexpected hands.

These elements of his philosophy—strategic betting, probabilistic assessment, and disciplined risk management—have allowed SIG to capitalize on market inefficiencies. By consistently outmaneuvering less informed players, SIG maintains its position as a leading market maker and options trader in the industry.

One example of an algorithm that could be employed in ruble trading is the mean-reversion strategy. This is based on the hypothesis that the price of an asset tends to revert to its mean over time. By estimating the mean price level of the ruble using historical data, traders can set algorithms to buy when the price dips below this level and sell when it rises above. Such strategies can be implemented and backtested using Python, as illustrated below:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load historical RUB data
data = pd.read_csv('ruble_data.csv', parse_dates=['Date'], index_col='Date')

# Calculate rolling mean
window = 20  # Use a 20-day rolling window
data['RollingMean'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=window).mean()

# Generate trading signals based on mean-reversion
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][window:] = np.where(data['Close'][window:] < data['RollingMean'][window:], 1, 0)

# Plot for visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='RUB Close Price')
plt.plot(data['RollingMean'], label=f'{window}-Day Rolling Mean', linestyle='--')
plt.scatter(data.index, data['Signal'] * data['Close'], label='Buy Signal', color='green', marker='^')
plt.title('Mean-Reversion Algo Trading Strategy')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This algorithm demonstrates how traders can systematically approach ruble trading, employing historical data trends to inform decisions.

model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=10, activation='relu')) # 10 features as input
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='linear'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Dummy data
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10)  # Features
y_train = np.random.rand(1000, 1)   # Target

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32)

This is achieved through its multi-layered architecture, which consists of the Application, Transport, Interledger, and Link layers. Each layer plays a distinct role in ensuring that transactions are executed efficiently, securely, and transparently.

1. **Application Layer**: This topmost layer is responsible for defining the end-user services and interfaces. It supports various payment applications by providing the necessary tools and protocols for interaction between users and the underlying transaction processes.

2. **Transport Layer**: The Transport Layer ensures that packets of transaction data are delivered reliably from the sender to the receiver. This layer is analogous to the transport protocols in networking, ensuring that data is transferred efficiently between participating nodes in the network.

3. **Interledger Layer**: Acting as the core of the ILP, this layer is responsible for defining the rules and standards that ensure interoperability across different ledgers. It breaks down transactions into packets, similar to the way internet protocols handle data on the web. By doing so, it allows for the flow of payments across multiple ledgers without the need for intermediaries.

4. **Link Layer**: The Link Layer manages the actual connections between different ledgers or payment networks. It oversees the establishment and closure of connections, ensuring that transaction paths are optimized for speed and security. Connectors, which are nodes operating on this layer, play a pivotal role. They facilitate the exchange and forwarding of packets between ledgers, thus enabling seamless currency conversion and cross-ledger transactions.

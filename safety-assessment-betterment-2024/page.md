## What is Betterment and how does it work?

Betterment is a company that helps people invest their money easily. It's what's called a robo-advisor, which means it uses computer programs to manage your investments without you having to do much work. You tell Betterment how much risk you want to take and what your goals are, and then it picks a mix of investments for you. This mix usually includes things like stocks and bonds, which are spread out to lower the risk.

When you put money into Betterment, it automatically puts that money into your chosen investment mix. Over time, Betterment keeps an eye on your investments and makes changes if needed to keep them in line with your goals. It also helps you save on taxes by doing something called tax-loss harvesting, which means it sells investments that have gone down in value to offset the taxes on the ones that have gone up. This way, you can grow your money without having to be an expert in investing.

## Why is safety important when using Betterment?

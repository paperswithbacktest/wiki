## What is a Zombie ETF?

A Zombie ETF is an exchange-traded fund that is still operating but not growing or attracting new investments. These ETFs often have low assets under management and struggle to remain profitable. They are called "zombies" because, like the mythical creatures, they exist but are not thriving or fully alive in the market.

The reasons behind an ETF becoming a zombie can vary. Sometimes, it's because the ETF focuses on a niche market that doesn't attract enough investors. Other times, it might be due to poor performance or high fees that drive investors away. Fund managers might keep these ETFs running in hopes of a turnaround, but often they end up merging with other funds or closing down if they can't become profitable again.

## How does a Zombie ETF differ from a regular ETF?

A Zombie ETF and a regular ETF are both types of investment funds that you can buy and sell on the stock market. The main difference is that a regular ETF is popular and growing, with lots of investors putting money into it. It's active and doing well, kind of like a healthy person. On the other hand, a Zombie ETF is struggling. It doesn't attract many new investors and may have low amounts of money invested in it. It's like a person who is just getting by but not really living fully.

Regular ETFs usually have lower fees because they manage more money, and they often perform well because they can invest in a variety of assets. Zombie ETFs, however, might have higher fees because they need to cover their costs with less money coming in. Also, because they are not as popular, they might not be able to invest in as many different things, which can make their performance worse. So, while a regular [ETF](/wiki/etf-trading-strategies) is a strong and active part of the market, a Zombie ETF is just hanging on and not doing much.

## What are the common characteristics of a Zombie ETF?

A Zombie ETF is an exchange-traded fund that is not doing well. It has low amounts of money invested in it, which means it's not popular with investors. These ETFs often have trouble attracting new money because people don't want to invest in something that's not growing. They might also have high fees because they need to cover their costs with less money coming in.

Because they are not popular, Zombie ETFs might not be able to invest in a lot of different things. This can make their performance worse compared to other ETFs that can spread their investments around more. Fund managers might keep these ETFs going in hopes that they will get better, but often they end up merging with other funds or closing down if they can't start making money again.

## Why do Zombie ETFs continue to exist?

Zombie ETFs keep going because the people who manage them hope they will get better. These managers think that maybe, with time, more people will want to invest in the ETF and it will start to grow again. They might also believe that the market will change in a way that helps the ETF do better. So, instead of giving up, they keep the ETF running, hoping for a turnaround.

Another reason is that closing an ETF can be hard and expensive. It takes a lot of work to shut down a fund, and it can cost a lot of money too. The managers might not want to deal with all that, so they keep the ETF going even if it's not doing well. This way, they can keep trying to make it better without having to start all over again with a new fund.

## What are the risks associated with investing in a Zombie ETF?

Investing in a Zombie ETF can be risky because these funds are not doing well. They might have low amounts of money in them, which means they are not popular with other investors. When an ETF is not popular, it can be harder for it to grow and make money for you. Also, Zombie ETFs often have high fees because they need to cover their costs with less money coming in. These high fees can eat into your returns, making it even harder for you to make a profit.

Another risk is that Zombie ETFs might close down. If an ETF closes, you might have to sell your shares at a bad time, which could mean you lose money. Even if the ETF doesn't close, it might not be able to invest in a lot of different things because it's not popular. This can make its performance worse compared to other ETFs that can spread their investments around more. So, when you invest in a Zombie ETF, you are taking a chance that it might not get better and could even get worse.

## How can investors identify a Zombie ETF?

Investors can spot a Zombie ETF by looking at how much money is in the fund. If an ETF has low assets under management, it means not many people are investing in it. This is a big sign that the ETF might be struggling. You can find this information easily on financial websites or the ETF's own website.

Another way to identify a Zombie ETF is by checking its performance and fees. If the ETF is not doing well compared to other similar funds and has high fees, it might be a Zombie ETF. High fees can make it harder for the ETF to make money for you because they take a bigger bite out of your returns. So, if you see an ETF with low assets, poor performance, and high fees, it's likely a Zombie ETF.

## What are some examples of Zombie ETFs?

A good example of a Zombie ETF is the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD). This ETF focuses on high-dividend financial stocks but has struggled to attract new investors. It has low assets under management and high fees, which makes it hard for it to perform well. Even though it keeps running, it's not growing or doing well in the market.

Another example is the Global X MSCI Argentina ETF (ARGT). This ETF aims to give investors exposure to the Argentine market, but it hasn't been very popular. It has low assets and high fees, and its performance has been poor. Fund managers keep it going, hoping that interest in the Argentine market will pick up, but for now, it's a Zombie ETF.

These examples show how Zombie ETFs can focus on niche markets or specific sectors but struggle to gain traction with investors. They keep operating but are not thriving, which makes them risky for people looking to invest their money.

## What strategies can be used to manage or revive a Zombie ETF?

To manage a Zombie ETF, fund managers might start by lowering the fees. High fees can scare investors away, so making the ETF cheaper could attract more people to invest. Another strategy is to change what the ETF invests in. If the current investments are not doing well, switching to different stocks or sectors might help improve performance. Fund managers could also try to market the ETF more, telling people why it's a good investment and how it could do better in the future.

Reviving a Zombie ETF can be tough, but it's not impossible. One way to do it is by merging with another ETF. If the Zombie ETF joins forces with a healthier one, it can use the other ETF's popularity and assets to start growing again. Another approach is to wait for market conditions to change. If the market shifts in a way that favors what the Zombie ETF invests in, more investors might start putting money into it. Sometimes, patience and a bit of luck can turn a struggling ETF around.

## How do regulatory bodies view Zombie ETFs?

Regulatory bodies, like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), keep an eye on all ETFs, including Zombie ETFs. They want to make sure that all ETFs are following the rules and treating investors fairly. If a Zombie ETF is not doing well, regulators might worry that it could hurt investors. They might check to see if the ETF's managers are doing everything they can to help the fund or if they are just letting it keep going without trying to fix it.

If regulators think a Zombie ETF is causing problems, they might step in. They could ask the ETF's managers to close it down or merge it with another fund. This is to protect investors from losing money. But, regulators usually don't force an ETF to close just because it's not doing well. They want to give the managers a chance to turn things around, as long as they are following the rules and trying to make the ETF better.

## What impact do Zombie ETFs have on the overall market?

Zombie ETFs do not have a big impact on the overall market. They are small and not popular, so they do not affect how the market moves much. Even though they are struggling, they are just a small part of the big world of investing. Most investors focus on bigger, healthier ETFs that have more money and do better. So, Zombie ETFs are like tiny fish in a huge pond - they don't change the water much.

However, if a lot of Zombie ETFs start to close at the same time, it might make some investors worried. They might think something is wrong with the market and start selling their investments. This could lead to more ups and downs in the market, but it would have to be a lot of Zombie ETFs closing to make a big difference. Usually, the market keeps going strong even with a few Zombie ETFs around.

## How has the prevalence of Zombie ETFs changed over time?

The number of Zombie ETFs has gone up and down over time. In the past few years, more and more ETFs have been created, and with so many choices, some of them don't do well. This means more Zombie ETFs have popped up. When the market is doing well, some Zombie ETFs might even start to get better and attract more investors. But when the market is not doing great, more ETFs can turn into Zombies because people are less likely to invest in them.

The trend of Zombie ETFs is also affected by what investors want. If people start to like certain types of investments, ETFs that focus on those areas can do well. But if those trends change, ETFs that were once popular can become Zombies. Fund managers keep an eye on these trends and try to adjust their ETFs to stay popular, but sometimes they can't keep up, and more Zombie ETFs appear. Overall, the number of Zombie ETFs can change a lot, depending on the market and what investors are looking for.

## What are the future prospects for Zombie ETFs in the investment landscape?

The future of Zombie ETFs in the investment world could go different ways. As more new ETFs come out all the time, some of them might turn into Zombies if they don't get enough investors. But if the market changes and people start liking what these Zombie ETFs invest in, they could start to do better and attract more money. Fund managers might try to fix these ETFs by lowering fees or changing what they invest in, hoping to bring them back to life.

On the other hand, if Zombie ETFs keep struggling and don't get better, they might close down or merge with other, healthier ETFs. This could mean fewer Zombie ETFs in the future. But as long as new ETFs keep being created, there will always be some that don't do well and become Zombies. So, while some Zombie ETFs might disappear, new ones could take their place, depending on how the market and investor interests change over time.

## Question: Why do ETFs become zombies?

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) can sometimes drift into a state referred to as "zombification," whereby they become less appealing to investors and fail to garner new capital. This phenomenon raises concerns about the lifecycle of ETFs and the factors contributing to their decline. Several elements are instrumental in driving ETFs toward this inactive state.

One primary reason ETFs become zombies is poor market timing. ETFs launched during unfavorable market conditions or economic downturns often struggle to attract initial investments. This timing mismatch can significantly impair their growth potential. For example, an ETF focused on a specific sector that undergoes a downturn shortly after the fund's inception may not gain the traction needed for sustainability.

Competition from larger, more established funds also plays a pivotal role. In a market where numerous ETFs vie for investor attention, funds with similar focuses might either siphon off potential investors or render a new ETF's unique selling proposition redundant. Larger funds often benefit from economies of scale, offering lower fees and greater [liquidity](/wiki/liquidity-risk-premium), making them more attractive alternatives.

Another critical [factor](/wiki/factor-investing) in the development of Zombie ETFs is their lack of differentiation. With the rapid proliferation of ETFs, products that fail to stand out with distinct investment angles or innovative strategies are at a higher risk of fading into obscurity. Investors typically seek funds that promise something novel or superior to existing options.

The lifecycle of an ETF, from inception to potential zombification, can be understood by analyzing its AUM (Assets Under Management) growth trajectory. Initially, an ETF might experience a rapid increase in AUM due to marketing, novelty, or favorable market trends. However, without sustained interest or competitive advantages, this growth can plateau or even decline, marking the onset of zombification. 

Mathematically, we can model the AUM growth rate ($G$) of an ETF as follows:

$$
G(t) = \frac{dA(t)}{dt}
$$

where $A(t)$ is the assets under management at time $t$. If $G(t) < 0$ for a sustained period, the ETF is likely on the path to becoming a Zombie ETF.

An illustration using Python might involve plotting the AUM of various ETFs to visualize their trajectories, identifying those tending towards zero growth.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Dummy data for three ETFs with time (months) on x-axis and AUM on y-axis; ETF3 is a Zombie ETF
months = list(range(1, 37))
aum_etf1 = [50 + 3*x for x in months]
aum_etf2 = [30 + 1.5*x + (0.02 * x**2) for x in months]
aum_etf3 = [40 - 0.5*x for x in months]  # Declining AUM

plt.plot(months, aum_etf1, label="ETF1")
plt.plot(months, aum_etf2, label="ETF2")
plt.plot(months, aum_etf3, label="ETF3 (Zombie)")

plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('AUM (in millions)')
plt.title('ETF AUM Growth Trajectories')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Analyzing such data can help investors and issuers identify ETFs at risk of becoming zombies and make informed decisions to mitigate these risks. Understanding the lifecycle and factors contributing to the zombification of ETFs is crucial for maintaining a robust, sustainable investment ecosystem.

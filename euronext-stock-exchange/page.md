Euronext watches the market all the time to catch any strange behavior. If they find something wrong, they can stop trading or punish the people who broke the rules. This helps keep the market a good place for companies and investors.

Euronext also works with other groups to make sure the market is fair. They talk to government agencies and other stock exchanges to share information and ideas.

## How does Euronext compare to other major stock exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ?

Euronext is different from the NYSE and NASDAQ in a few ways. First, Euronext is based in Europe and covers several countries like France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Ireland, Norway, and Italy. This makes it easier for companies in these countries to work together and for investors to buy and sell stocks across different European markets. The NYSE and NASDAQ, on the other hand, are both in the United States and mainly focus on American companies. Euronext also has its own special trading platform called Optiq, which helps it handle trades quickly and efficiently.

Another difference is the types of companies listed on these exchanges. Euronext has a mix of big and small companies from different countries, while the NYSE and NASDAQ are known for having many big American companies, especially in technology and finance. Euronext also uses cloud computing to make its systems better, which is something it shares with NASDAQ but not with the NYSE. Overall, Euronext helps connect the European market, while the NYSE and NASDAQ focus more on the U.S. market.

## What are the future growth strategies and expansions planned by Euronext?

Euronext wants to grow and become even more important in Europe. They plan to do this by adding more countries to their network. They already have offices in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Ireland, Norway, and Italy. They are looking at other countries that might want to join Euronext. This will help more companies sell their stocks and let more people invest in Europe. Euronext also wants to make their technology even better. They will keep working on their trading platform, Optiq, and use more cloud computing to make trading faster and easier.

Another way Euronext plans to grow is by offering more types of financial products. They already have stocks, bonds, ETFs, and derivatives, but they want to add even more. This will give investors more choices and help Euronext attract more people to their market. They also want to work more with other stock exchanges around the world. By sharing information and working together, Euronext can help make the global market stronger and more connected. This will help them grow and become an even bigger part of the world's economy.

infura_url = "YOUR_INFURA_URL"
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(infura_url))

# Sender address and private key
sender_address = "0xYourWalletAddress"
private_key = "YourPrivateKey"

# Transaction details
transaction = {
    'to': '0xReceivingWalletAddress',
    'value': web3.toWei(1, 'ether'),
    'gas': 21000,
    'gasPrice': web3.toWei('50', 'gwei'),
    'nonce': web3.eth.getTransactionCount(sender_address),
}

# Sign the transaction
signed_txn = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(transaction, private_key)

# Send the transaction
txn_hash = web3.eth.sendRawTransaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction)
print(f"Transaction Hash: {txn_hash.hex()}")
```

This example highlights how algorithmic trading operations can interface with Ethereum wallets, demonstrating the practical application of these digital tools in executing trades.

## What is a major shareholder?

A major shareholder is someone who owns a big part of a company's stock. When you own stock, you own a piece of the company. If you own a lot of stock, you have a lot of say in what the company does. Usually, a major shareholder owns at least 5% or 10% of the company's total stock. This gives them a lot of power and influence over the company's decisions.

Major shareholders can affect the company in many ways. They can vote on important issues at shareholder meetings, like who should be on the board of directors or whether to approve big company changes. Sometimes, major shareholders can even push the company to make decisions that they think are best. Because they own so much stock, what they say and do can really matter to the company's future.

Sometimes, major shareholders might also focus on short-term gains, like making a lot of money quickly, while other stakeholders might care more about the company's long-term health. For instance, major shareholders might want Procter & Gamble to invest less in sustainable practices to save money now, but this could harm the environment and the company's reputation in the future. This can create tension because what's good for the shareholders in the short term might not be good for the company or other stakeholders in the long run. Balancing these different interests is a big challenge for Procter & Gamble's leaders.

## How do changes in major shareholder composition affect Procter & Gamble's stock performance?

When big investors like The Vanguard Group or BlackRock buy more stock, it often makes other people think the company is doing well. This can make the stock price go up because more people want to buy it. On the other hand, if these big shareholders start selling their stock, it can make others worry that something is wrong with the company. This can cause the stock price to go down because fewer people want to buy it.

But it's not just about buying and selling. If new big shareholders come in with different ideas about how the company should be run, it can also change the stock price. For example, if a new major shareholder wants Procter & Gamble to focus more on green products, this could make some investors happy and others worried. Happy investors might buy more stock, pushing the price up, while worried investors might sell, pushing the price down. So, the mix of major shareholders and what they want can really shake things up for Procter & Gamble's stock.

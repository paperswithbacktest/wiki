```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import pandas as pd

# Load trading data
data = pd.read_csv('trading_data.csv')
X = data.drop('risk_label', axis=1)
y = data['risk_label']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate the model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
```

This means looking for companies that are selling for less than they are really worth. Traders who use this strategy believe that if they buy these undervalued shares and hold onto them, the price will go up over time. Another strategy is "growth investing," where traders look for companies that are growing fast. They think that if a company is doing well and getting bigger, its share price will also go up.

Each of these strategies has its own way of trying to make money, and traders often mix and match them to find what works best for them.

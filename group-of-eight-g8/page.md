## What are the criticisms against the G8?

Some people do not like the G8 because they think it is not fair. They say that the G8 countries are rich and powerful, and they make decisions that help themselves more than others. People also think that the G8 does not listen to poor countries or let them have a say in important decisions. This makes some people feel that the G8 is not good for the whole world, just for the countries in the group.

Another criticism is that the G8 talks a lot but does not do enough to help. People say that the leaders make big plans and promises, but they do not always follow through. For example, they might talk about helping poor countries or fighting climate change, but then not do much to make it happen. This makes some people think that the G8 meetings are not very useful and that the group should do more to make the world a better place.

## How does the G8 interact with other international organizations like the G20?

The G8, now known as the G7, works with other big groups like the G20 to talk about important world problems.

They want to work together to make the world a better place. For example, they might talk about how to help countries that are struggling or how to stop climate change.

Even though the G7 and G20 are different groups, they often talk about the same issues. The G7 leaders might bring ideas from their meetings to the G20, and the G20 might do the same. This helps them work together to solve big problems. The G7 and G20 both want to help the world, so they try to work together as much as they can.

## What impact has the G8 had on global issues such as climate change and poverty?

The G8, now called the G7, has tried to help with big world problems like climate change and poverty. They talk about these issues at their meetings and make plans to help. For example, they have promised to lower the amount of pollution they make to help stop climate change. They also talk about giving money and help to poor countries to make their lives better. But some people say that the G8 does not do enough to make these plans happen. They think the G8 talks a lot but does not always follow through with real action.

On climate change, the G8 has made agreements to cut down on harmful gases and to help countries that are hurt by climate change. They have also talked about using more clean energy like wind and solar power. But it is hard to make big changes, and some people think the G8 could do more. For poverty, the G8 has promised to give money and help to poor countries. They want to help these countries grow and make life better for people. But some people say that the help does not always reach the people who need it the most, and that the G8 should do more to make sure their plans work.

It's a part of the process called a "prospectus supplement," which adds to the information in the main prospectus.

When a company files Form 424B5, it helps investors make informed decisions. The form includes updates or changes to the information that was in the original prospectus. This way, investors get the latest details before they decide to buy the securities.

# Sample data
data = {'close': [1.1010, 1.1020, 1.1030, 1.1040, 1.1050]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

def moving_average(data, window_size):
    return data.rolling(window=window_size).mean()

# Calculate moving averages
short_window = 2
long_window = 3

df['short_mavg'] = moving_average(df['close'], short_window)
df['long_mavg'] = moving_average(df['close'], long_window)

# Generate signals
df['signal'] = 0
df['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(df['short_mavg'][short_window:] > df['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1, 0)

# Print generated signals
print(df[['close', 'short_mavg', 'long_mavg', 'signal']])
```

This example demonstrates the potential of algorithmic strategies in identifying profitable trading opportunities based on simple moving averages. Such strategies can be expanded and refined to include more sophisticated models and indicators, highlighting the adaptive and scalable nature of algo trading in forex.

Python, among other programming languages, is often used to develop algorithmic trading systems due to its robust libraries and ease of use. A simple example of an algorithmic trading strategy could be based on moving averages, where trades are executed when the short-term average crosses the long-term average. A basic Python implementation might look like this:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Sample data: closing prices
prices = pd.Series([100, 101, 102, 100, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93])

# Calculate moving averages
short_window = 3
long_window = 5

signals = pd.DataFrame(index=prices.index)
signals['price'] = prices
signals['short_mavg'] = prices.rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
signals['long_mavg'] = prices.rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Generate signals
signals['signal'] = 0.0
signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

print(signals)
```
This script illustrates the basic logic behind detecting crossover points in moving averages, a common technique in algo trading to identify buy and sell signals.

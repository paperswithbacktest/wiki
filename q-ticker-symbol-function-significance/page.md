The ability of algorithms to leverage ticker symbols for tracking stock performance is pivotal. Algorithms can process massive amounts of data linked to ticker symbols to generate insights and predict future movements. These systems employ various statistical methods and machine learning models to analyze trends associated with each ticker, thus informing trading strategies. For instance, an algorithm might calculate the exponential moving average (EMA) for a stock denoted by its ticker symbol:

```python
def calculate_ema(prices, window):
    alpha = 2 / (window + 1)
    ema = [sum(prices[:window]) / window]
    for price in prices[window:]:
        ema.append((price - ema[-1]) * alpha + ema[-1])
    return ema
```

In this example, the algorithm could use the EMA to assess whether a stock is experiencing an upwards or downwards trend, prompting either a buy or a sell action.

Accuracy and timeliness are paramount when using ticker symbols in trading algorithms, as decisions are often made in fractions of a second.

## What is a Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS)?

A Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS) is an agreement between the United States and Canada that makes it easier for companies in these countries to sell securities in the other country. It simplifies the process by allowing companies to use the same documents they use at home to register their securities in the other country. This means less paperwork and fewer differences in rules to worry about.

The MJDS helps companies save time and money because they don't have to prepare separate sets of documents for each country. It also helps investors by giving them more choices and easier access to investment opportunities in both countries. This system has been in place since the late 1980s and has made it simpler for businesses to grow and for investors to diversify their portfolios.

## Why was the MJDS created?

The MJDS was created to make it easier for companies in the U.S. and Canada to sell their stocks and bonds in each other's country. Before the MJDS, companies had to follow different rules and fill out different forms for each country. This was hard and expensive. The MJDS lets companies use the same documents they use at home to sell their securities in the other country. This saves time and money.

The MJDS also helps investors. It gives them more choices because they can buy stocks and bonds from companies in both the U.S. and Canada more easily. This means investors can spread their money around more and maybe make better investments. The MJDS started in the late 1980s and has been helping companies and investors ever since.

## Which countries participate in the MJDS?

The Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS) is an agreement between the United States and Canada. These are the only two countries that participate in the MJDS. The agreement makes it easier for companies in these countries to sell their stocks and bonds in the other country.

The MJDS allows companies to use the same documents they use at home to register their securities in the other country. This saves time and money because companies do not have to prepare different sets of documents for each country. It also helps investors by giving them more choices and easier access to investment opportunities in both countries.

## What types of securities can be issued under the MJDS?

Under the MJDS, companies can issue stocks and bonds. Stocks are shares in a company, and bonds are loans that companies promise to pay back with interest. This means that if a company in the U.S. or Canada wants to sell these kinds of securities in the other country, they can use the same documents they use at home.

This makes it easier for companies because they don't have to fill out different forms for each country. It also helps investors because they can buy stocks and bonds from companies in both the U.S. and Canada more easily. This gives investors more choices and can help them spread their money around more.

## How does the MJDS benefit issuers?

The MJDS helps companies in the U.S. and Canada save time and money. Before the MJDS, companies had to fill out different forms and follow different rules for each country. This was hard and expensive. With the MJDS, companies can use the same documents they use at home to sell their stocks and bonds in the other country. This means less paperwork and fewer headaches for the companies.

The MJDS also makes it easier for companies to grow. They can reach more investors in both countries without having to deal with complicated rules. This can help companies raise more money to expand their business. Overall, the MJDS makes it simpler for companies to do business across the border, which can lead to more growth and success.

## What are the key differences between MJDS and traditional SEC filings?

The main difference between MJDS and traditional SEC filings is the paperwork. With MJDS, companies from the U.S. and Canada can use the same documents they use at home to sell their stocks and bonds in the other country. This means less paperwork because they don't have to fill out different forms for each country. Traditional SEC filings, on the other hand, require companies to prepare separate documents that follow the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules.

Another key difference is the cost and time involved. MJDS saves companies time and money because they don't have to deal with extra paperwork and different rules. This makes it easier for them to reach investors in both countries. With traditional SEC filings, companies have to spend more time and money to prepare the right documents and make sure they follow all the rules. This can slow down the process of selling securities and make it more expensive for the companies.

## What documentation is required for an MJDS filing?

For an MJDS filing, companies need to use the documents they already have from their home country. If a company is from Canada, it can use its Canadian documents to sell securities in the U.S. If a company is from the U.S., it can use its American documents to sell securities in Canada. This means they don't have to create new documents just for the other country.

The main documents needed are the ones that the company uses to report its financials and business activities at home. For example, a Canadian company would use its Canadian prospectus or financial statements, and a U.S. company would use its U.S. registration statement or annual report. These documents have to meet the rules of the home country's securities regulator, but they don't need extra paperwork for the other country.

## How does the review process for MJDS filings work?

When a company wants to sell securities in the other country using MJDS, it sends its home country documents to the securities regulator of that country. For example, a Canadian company sends its Canadian documents to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC then reviews these documents to make sure they meet the basic rules for selling securities in the U.S. This review process is simpler and faster than traditional SEC filings because the company doesn't have to prepare new documents.

The review process mainly checks if the documents are complete and follow the rules of the home country. If everything looks good, the SEC will approve the filing, and the company can start selling its securities in the U.S. If there are any problems, the SEC might ask the company to fix them before approval. This back-and-forth can take some time, but it's still easier than starting from scratch with a new set of documents.

## What are the eligibility criteria for issuers wanting to use the MJDS?

To use the MJDS, issuers need to meet certain rules. For companies from Canada, they must be reporting issuers in a Canadian province or territory. They also need to have been reporting for at least 12 months and must have filed all the required documents with the Canadian securities regulators. For U.S. companies, they need to be registered with the SEC and have been reporting for at least 12 months as well. They should have all their required filings up to date with the SEC.

The MJDS also has rules about the size of the company. Generally, the company needs to be big enough, which means it should have a certain amount of public float or market value of its shares. This helps make sure that only well-established companies can use the MJDS. By meeting these criteria, issuers can take advantage of the simpler process to sell their securities in the other country.

## How does the MJDS affect investor protection?

The MJDS helps protect investors by making it easier for them to get information about companies in the U.S. and Canada. Since companies can use their home country's documents, investors can see the same financial reports and other important information that the company shares with its home country's regulators. This means investors in both countries have access to the same details, which can help them make better choices about where to put their money.

However, there are some concerns about investor protection with the MJDS. Because the rules in the U.S. and Canada are a bit different, investors might find it hard to understand all the details. Also, since companies don't have to prepare new documents for the other country, there might be less oversight. But overall, the MJDS still aims to keep investors safe by making sure they have the information they need to make smart investment decisions.

## What challenges do issuers face when using the MJDS?

Issuers using the MJDS can face some challenges. One big challenge is making sure all their home country documents meet the rules of the other country. Even though the MJDS makes things simpler, companies still need to check that their financial reports and other documents follow the basic rules of the country where they want to sell their securities. This can take time and effort, especially if the rules are different between the U.S. and Canada.

Another challenge is dealing with any questions or requests from the regulators in the other country. If the SEC or Canadian regulators find something missing or not clear in the documents, they might ask the company to fix it. This back-and-forth can slow down the process of getting approval to sell securities. It's important for companies to be ready to answer these questions quickly and correctly to keep things moving smoothly.

## What future developments or reforms are anticipated for the MJDS?

People who know about the MJDS think it might change in the future to make things even easier for companies and investors. One idea is to update the rules so that more types of companies can use the MJDS. Right now, only big, well-established companies can use it. If the rules change, smaller companies might be able to sell their stocks and bonds in the other country too. Another idea is to make the rules about documents even simpler. This could mean less paperwork for companies and faster approval from regulators.

There's also talk about making the MJDS work with other countries, not just the U.S. and Canada. If this happens, companies in more countries could sell their securities more easily. This would give investors more choices and help companies grow their business in new places. But making these changes will take time and agreement between the countries involved. Until then, the MJDS will keep helping companies and investors in the U.S. and Canada.

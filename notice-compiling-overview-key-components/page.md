To implement information synthesis in a practical setting, a Python script using libraries like pandas for data handling and scikit-learn for machine learning might look like this:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load historical market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')
X = data['Previous_Price'].values.reshape(-1, 1)
y = data['Price'].values

# Initialize and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predicted_price = model.predict([[latest_price]])
print(f"Predicted next price: {predicted_price[0]}")
```

The continuous evolution of tools and technologies in data processing and machine learning ensures that the process of information synthesis remains at the forefront of developing trading strategies. As algorithmic trading advances, the ability to synthesize information efficiently and accurately will be a significant determinant of success in the financial markets.

import pandas as pd

# Load historical price data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv')

# Calculate moving averages
data['Short_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['Long_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Generate signals
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['Short_MA'][50:] > data['Long_MA'][50:], 1, -1)

# Backtest
positions = data['Signal'].shift()
returns = data['Close'].pct_change()
strategy_returns = positions * returns
```

## What is the 'All Weather' portfolio strategy developed by Ray Dalio?

The 'All Weather' portfolio strategy is a way of investing that Ray Dalio created to help people make money no matter what is happening in the economy. He wanted to make a plan that would work well even if the market went up or down. The idea is to spread out your money in different kinds of investments. This way, if one type of investment does badly, the others might do well and balance it out. Ray calls this diversification, and it's a big part of the 'All Weather' strategy.

In the 'All Weather' portfolio, Ray suggests putting your money into four main types of investments: stocks, bonds, commodities, and inflation-protected securities. Each of these types reacts differently to changes in the economy. By having a mix of all these, the portfolio can handle different economic situations. For example, if the economy is doing well, stocks might go up. But if the economy is struggling, bonds might do better. Ray's goal with the 'All Weather' strategy is to help people keep their money safe and growing, no matter what happens in the world.

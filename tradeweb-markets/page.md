```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Simulating some trading data
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # Assume 5 features
y = np.random.rand(100)  # Target variable (e.g., future price movement)

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Using a random forest model to predict future price movement
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting on the test data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluating the model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy on test data: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

Looking forward, trading platforms are expected to incorporate more advanced features powered by AI, facilitating more intuitive and user-friendly experiences.

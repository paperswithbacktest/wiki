# Sample Python code for a simple moving average crossover strategy
def simple_moving_average(prices, short_window=40, long_window=100):
    # Calculate short-term and long-term moving averages
    short_mavg = talib.SMA(np.array(prices), timeperiod=short_window)
    long_mavg = talib.SMA(np.array(prices), timeperiod=long_window)

    # Generate buy/sell signals
    buy_signal = short_mavg > long_mavg
    sell_signal = short_mavg < long_mavg

    return buy_signal, sell_signal

# Example usage of the function
prices = pd.Series([price_data])  # Replace price_data with actual price values
buy, sell = simple_moving_average(prices)
```

The benefits of algorithmic trading are multifaceted. It enhances efficiency by eliminating manual errors and rationalizing decision-making processes. Moreover, algorithmic trading allows for the [backtesting](/wiki/backtesting) of strategies against historical data, thereby assessing their viability before implementation.

## What are the fees and commissions associated with trading on FOREX.com?

When you trade on FOREX.com, you need to know about the fees and commissions. For the Standard Account, you don't pay a commission per trade, but you do pay something called a spread. The spread is the difference between the price you buy a currency at and the price you sell it at. FOREX.com charges different spreads depending on what you are trading, but they are usually pretty low. This makes the Standard Account a good choice for people who don't trade a lot.

If you use the Commission Account, you will pay a small commission for each trade you make, but the spreads are lower than on the Standard Account. This can save you money if you trade a lot. The commission is usually a few dollars per trade, but it can add up if you make many trades. For the DMA Account, the fees and commissions can be different and might be more complicated, so it's good to check with FOREX.com directly to understand them better.

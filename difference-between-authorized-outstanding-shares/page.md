## What are shares in a company?

Shares in a company are pieces of ownership that a company divides into smaller parts and sells to people. When you buy a share, you become a part-owner of the company. The more shares you own, the bigger your ownership in the company. Companies sell shares to raise money, which they can use to grow their business, buy new equipment, or pay off debts.

People buy shares because they hope the company will do well and the value of the shares will go up. If the company makes a profit, it might also pay some of that money to shareholders as dividends. However, buying shares can be risky because if the company does poorly, the value of the shares can go down, and you could lose money. So, it's important to think carefully before buying shares and maybe talk to a financial advisor.

## What does 'authorized shares' mean?

Authorized shares are the maximum number of shares a company is allowed to create and sell according to its legal documents. These documents are called the company's articles of incorporation. When a company starts, it decides how many shares it might need in the future and writes that number down. This number can be changed later, but it needs the approval of the people who own the company, called shareholders.

Having authorized shares is like having a limit on how many pieces of the company can be sold. The company doesn't have to sell all of these shares right away. It can sell some now and keep the rest for later if it needs more money. But it can't sell more shares than the authorized number without changing its legal documents first.

## What does 'outstanding shares' mean?

Outstanding shares are the total number of shares that a company has sold to people and that people still own. When a company sells shares, those shares become outstanding. If people sell their shares to someone else, the number of outstanding shares stays the same because the shares are still out there, just owned by someone different.

Sometimes, a company might buy back some of its own shares. When this happens, the number of outstanding shares goes down because those shares are no longer owned by the public. The number of outstanding shares is important because it helps figure out how much each share is worth and how much of the company each shareholder owns.

## How are authorized shares determined?

When a company starts, it decides how many shares it might need in the future. This decision is written down in the company's legal documents, called the articles of incorporation. The number of shares the company can create and sell is called the authorized shares. The company picks this number to make sure it has enough shares to sell if it needs to raise money later.

The number of authorized shares can be changed later, but it needs the approval of the people who own the company, called shareholders. If the company thinks it needs more shares than it first planned, it can ask the shareholders to vote on increasing the number of authorized shares. This helps the company be ready for future growth or other needs without having to start over with new legal documents.

## How do companies decide on the number of outstanding shares?

When a company starts, it decides how many shares it wants to sell to people. This decision is based on how much money the company needs to start or grow its business. The company might sell all these shares right away, or it might sell some now and keep some for later. The shares that the company has sold and that people still own are called outstanding shares.

As time goes on, the number of outstanding shares can change. If the company sells more shares to raise more money, the number of outstanding shares goes up. If the company buys back some of its own shares, the number of outstanding shares goes down. The company keeps track of these changes to know how many shares are out there and how much of the company each shareholder owns.

## Can the number of authorized shares be changed, and if so, how?

Yes, the number of authorized shares can be changed. When a company starts, it writes down how many shares it can create and sell in its legal documents, called the articles of incorporation. If the company later decides it needs more shares than it first planned, it can ask to change this number.

To change the number of authorized shares, the company needs to get the approval of its shareholders. The company will hold a meeting where shareholders vote on whether to increase the number of authorized shares. If most shareholders agree, the company can change its legal documents to allow for more shares. This helps the company be ready for future growth or other needs without having to start over with new legal documents.

## What is the relationship between authorized and outstanding shares?

Authorized shares are the total number of shares a company can create and sell, as written in its legal documents. This number is decided when the company starts and can be changed later if the shareholders agree. Outstanding shares, on the other hand, are the actual number of shares that the company has sold to people and that people still own. When a company sells shares, those shares become outstanding.

The relationship between authorized and outstanding shares is that outstanding shares can never be more than authorized shares. A company can sell as many shares as it wants up to the number of authorized shares, but it can't sell more than that without changing its legal documents. If a company wants to sell more shares than it has authorized, it needs to get the shareholders to agree to increase the number of authorized shares first.

## How do authorized and outstanding shares affect a company's market capitalization?

Market capitalization, or market cap, is how much a company is worth based on its stock price. It's calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current price of one share. So, the number of outstanding shares directly affects the market cap. If a company has more outstanding shares, and the price per share stays the same, the market cap will be higher. If the company buys back some shares and the number of outstanding shares goes down, the market cap will be lower, unless the price per share goes up enough to make up for it.

Authorized shares don't directly affect the market cap because they are just the maximum number of shares a company can sell. But if a company decides to sell more shares up to its authorized limit, this can increase the number of outstanding shares. If that happens, and the price per share stays the same, the market cap will go up. So, while authorized shares don't change the market cap by themselves, they give the company the option to increase its outstanding shares, which can then affect the market cap.

## What are the implications of issuing more shares than are outstanding?

When a company issues more shares than are currently outstanding, it means the company is selling new shares to people. This can happen if the company needs more money for things like growing the business or paying off debts. The company can only do this if it has enough authorized shares, which is the maximum number of shares it can create and sell according to its legal documents. If it doesn't have enough authorized shares, the company needs to get the shareholders to agree to increase this number first.

Issuing more shares can change how much of the company each shareholder owns. If you own shares and the company issues more, your ownership percentage goes down unless you buy more of the new shares. This is called dilution. Also, if more shares are issued, it can affect the company's market capitalization, which is how much the company is worth based on its stock price. More shares might make the market cap go up if the price per share stays the same, but it can also make each share worth less if the market thinks the company is selling too many shares.

## How do authorized and outstanding shares impact shareholder voting rights?

When a company decides how many shares it can create and sell, it writes this down in its legal documents. This number is called authorized shares. The number of authorized shares doesn't directly change how much say shareholders have in company decisions. But, if the company wants to sell more shares than it has already sold, it needs to make sure it has enough authorized shares. If it doesn't, it has to ask the shareholders to vote on increasing the number of authorized shares. So, the number of authorized shares can affect voting if the company wants to change it.

The number of shares that people actually own, called outstanding shares, does affect how much say shareholders have. Each share usually gives the owner one vote in company decisions. So, if you own more shares, you have more votes. When a company sells more shares, it can change how much of the company each shareholder owns. If you own shares and the company sells more, your ownership percentage goes down unless you buy more of the new shares. This can make your voting power less, because there are more shares out there, and more votes to go around.

## What are the financial reporting requirements for authorized and outstanding shares?

Companies have to tell people about their authorized and outstanding shares in their financial reports. These reports are important because they help people understand how the company is doing. In the reports, the company writes down how many shares it is allowed to create and sell, which is called authorized shares. It also writes down how many shares it has actually sold to people, which is called outstanding shares. This information is usually found in the company's annual report or in a special part of the report called the "Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity."

The rules about what companies have to report come from places like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States. The SEC makes sure that companies tell the truth about their shares and other important things. If a company changes the number of authorized shares, it has to tell the SEC and its shareholders about it. The same goes for if the number of outstanding shares changes, like if the company sells more shares or buys some back. This helps everyone know what's going on with the company's shares and makes sure the company is being honest.

## How do changes in authorized and outstanding shares influence stock price and investor perception?

When a company changes its authorized shares, it can affect how investors feel about the company. If the company wants to increase the number of authorized shares, it might be because it needs more money. This can make investors worried that the company is not doing well and needs to sell more shares to stay afloat. On the other hand, if the company is doing well and wants to increase authorized shares to grow even more, investors might see this as a good sign. But, if the company keeps changing its authorized shares a lot, it might make investors think the company is not sure about its plans, which can make them less confident in the company.

Changes in the number of outstanding shares can also affect the stock price and how investors see the company. If the company sells more shares, it can make the stock price go down because there are more shares out there, which can make each share worth less. This is called dilution. But, if the company uses the money from selling more shares to grow and make more profit, the stock price might go up over time. If the company buys back its own shares, it can make the stock price go up because there are fewer shares out there, which can make each share worth more. Investors watch these changes closely because they want to know if their shares will be worth more or less in the future.

## What are Outstanding Shares and How Can We Understand Them?

Outstanding shares represent the total number of shares that a company has issued and are currently held by all its shareholders. These include shares held by individual investors, institutional investors, and insiders. They are the shares that are actively traded in the stock market and exclude any shares that the company has repurchased and holds in its treasury.

Outstanding shares play a critical role in determining several key financial metrics. For instance, the earnings per share (EPS) of a company is calculated by dividing the company's net income by its number of outstanding shares:

$$
\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Outstanding Shares}}
$$

This formula highlights the importance of outstanding shares in evaluating the profitability of a company on a per-share basis. An increase in outstanding shares, without a corresponding increase in net income, would lead to a dilution of EPS, potentially affecting investor perception and share price.

Furthermore, the market value of a company, commonly known as market capitalization, is calculated by multiplying the current share price by the number of outstanding shares:

$$
\text{Market Capitalization} = \text{Share Price} \times \text{Outstanding Shares}
$$

This provides investors with a snapshot of the total value of the company as perceived by the stock market. A higher number of outstanding shares, therefore, contributes to a larger market capitalization, assuming a stable share price.

Additionally, the pool of outstanding shares determines the [liquidity](/wiki/liquidity-risk-premium) of a company's stock. A higher number of shares can improve liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell without significantly affecting the stock price. However, this also means that the stock could be more volatile, especially if large shareholders, such as institutional investors, decide to buy or sell large quantities of shares.

Overall, understanding outstanding shares is essential for investors and analysts as these shares are fundamental to the assessment of a company’s financial health and market performance.

## What are the considerations for investors and companies?

Investors and companies must pay close attention to the implications of authorized versus outstanding shares, particularly in the context of ownership stake calculations and financial ratios. Understanding the difference is essential for making informed decisions. Authorized shares represent the maximum number of shares a company is permitted to issue, while outstanding shares are those currently in the hands of investors, including institutional stakeholders and insiders.

For investors, this distinction impacts metrics such as the percentage of ownership and the calculation of earnings per share (EPS). Knowing the number of outstanding shares is crucial for accurate EPS calculation:

$$
\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income} - \text{Dividends on Preferred Stock}}{\text{Average Outstanding Shares}}
$$

For companies, the strategic allocation of authorized shares demands careful consideration. Having a surplus of authorized shares can serve as a buffer for various corporate activities, such as raising capital through new stock issues, stock splits, or employee stock option plans. However, companies must maintain a balance to prevent dilution of control or susceptibility to hostile takeovers. A high number of available authorized shares can facilitate a takeover if a substantial portion remains unissued.

Monitoring both authorized and outstanding shares can enhance decision-making related to investing or maintaining governance structures. Companies often need to weigh the trade-offs between the potential for growth and the necessity for control. For example, issuing additional shares might provide the capital needed for expansion but can dilute existing shareholders' ownership stakes. Accordingly, companies might limit the number of authorized shares to prevent unwanted shifts in voter power among shareholders, ensuring stability in corporate governance.

Proper management and understanding of these concepts aid in developing effective strategies that align with both the growth trajectory of the company and the interests of shareholders. Consequently, informed stakeholders can leverage this knowledge to optimize both investment returns and corporate governance efforts.

## What are examples of authorized vs. outstanding shares?

Apple Inc. provides a practical example illustrating the distinction between authorized and outstanding shares. As a leading technology company, Apple has strategically authorized significantly more shares than those currently outstanding. This approach offers the company considerable flexibility. One key advantage is the ability to issue additional shares without needing immediate shareholder approval, which is essential for operations like stock splits, mergers, acquisitions, and employee incentive programs. By having a large pool of authorized shares, Apple can efficiently undertake stock splits, which increase the number of shares available while maintaining the company's market capitalization. This tactic often makes shares more accessible to a broader range of investors and can potentially enhance liquidity.

Consider a hypothetical scenario where Apple has authorized 25 billion shares but has only 16 billion outstanding shares. In this case, the difference of 9 billion shares serves as a strategic reserve. This flexibility can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Available Shares for Future Use} = \text{Authorized Shares} - \text{Outstanding Shares}
$$

Applying the numbers,

$$
\text{Available Shares for Future Use} = 25 \text{ billion} - 16 \text{ billion} = 9 \text{ billion}
$$

Other companies might take a different approach by authorizing fewer shares than would potentially be issued under various circumstances. This strategy is employed to maintain more rigid control over corporate decisions and shareholder voting power. By limiting the number of authorized shares, a company can safeguard itself against the dilution of existing shares, retaining stronger control over the corporation's strategic direction.

For instance, a privately-held corporation seeking to maintain a tight grip over its decision-making might authorize only slightly more shares than are outstanding, prioritizing control over flexibility. This method generally reflects a company's desire to restrict the number of new investors and keep the ownership structure concentrated among existing shareholders.

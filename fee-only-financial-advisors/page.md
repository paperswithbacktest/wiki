## What is a fee-only financial advisor?

A fee-only financial advisor is someone who gets paid directly by their clients for the advice they give. They don't earn money from commissions on products like insurance or investments. This means their advice is not influenced by what will earn them more money, but by what is best for the client.

This type of advisor can charge in different ways. They might charge a flat fee for a specific service, an hourly rate, or a percentage of the assets they manage for you. Because they are paid directly by you, it's easier to see exactly what you're paying for and how much it costs. This transparency can help build trust between the advisor and the client.

## How does a fee-only financial advisor differ from other types of financial advisors?

## Can you explain the potential conflicts of interest with fee-only versus commission-based advisors?

Fee-only financial advisors don't have the same conflicts of interest as commission-based advisors.

This can create a conflict of interest because they might be tempted to recommend products that pay them more, even if those products aren't the best for you. For example, they might push you to buy a certain investment because it gives them a big commission, not because it's the best choice for your financial situation. This can make it harder to trust their advice, as their recommendations might be influenced by what benefits them financially.

## What are some common fee structures used by fee-only financial advisors?

Fee-only financial advisors have different ways to charge for their services. One common way is a flat fee. This means you pay a set amount for a specific service, like making a financial plan.

For example, if you have $100,000 and they charge 1%, you would pay $1,000 a year. This fee can go up or down depending on how much money you have with them. Some advisors might also use a retainer fee, where you pay a regular amount each month or year for ongoing advice and support.
